Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland   4. Data Analytics and Rehabilitation Technology Lab, Lake Lucerne Institute, Vitznau , Switzerland   josef.schoenhammer@ llui.org  Abstract:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) gains prominence due to its spatial resolution and resistance to motion artifacts, making it ideal for neuroscience and brain -computer interface applications. However, simplifying and standardizing its data pr ocessing remains a challenge. This project introduced fnirsPy , a wrapper built on MNE -Python and MNE -NIRS that allows easy deployment of customizable end -to-end data processing pipelines with minimal code. It provides a standard pipeline following current recommendations and implements  new preprocessing methods. fnirsPy , tested with data from 22 subjects across two systems, significantly enhances data handling, furthers processing standardization, and improves reproducibility in neuroimaging research.   Introduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non -invasive neuroimaging technique that is frequently used due to its advantages in spatial resolution and robustness to motion artifacts. However, challenges remain in data processing due to the lack of usable and standardized data processing pipelines.  Usage of existing software and libraries can be non -trivial and requires significant overhead code. This project developed fnirsPy , an open -source wrapper around MNE Python libraries with additional methods and features that makes it easy to deploy complete yet customizable end -to-end data processing pipelines for custom fNIRS data with only a few lines of code. It implements a standardized procedure f or handling data and includes a  default pipeline that adheres to current recommendations for fNIRS data processing. The project aims to make open data processing functionality more usable and to standardize fNIRS data processing to enhance reproducibility across studies.   Methods: fnirsPy  was developed on MNE -Python  [1] and MNE -NIRS  [2] such that a ll MNE functions can still be utilize d harmoniously.  A standard pipeline was implemented the follows current recommendations for fNIRS data processing [3] , as well as  new methods that are not available  in MNE  (e.g., automatic cardiac -signal based channel selection ), and plotting functions following  publication recommendations  [4]. We used data from  overall 22 subjects, collected with  two fNIRS systems  (optohive, ETH Z ürich, Switzerland; Lightnirs, Shimadzu , Japan) , during working memory lab tasks .   Results: The use of fnirsPy  significantly reduced the complexity and amount of code required to process fNIRS data, from data importation to final analysis steps  (see Figure) .  Conclusion:  fnirsPy  offers a user -friendly, flexible tool, such that users can focus on scientific questions without much toil over writing code. The tool adheres to standard data handling, processing, and publication guidelines, thus supporting reproducibility in neuroimaging research. The system is currently in a pre -alpha stage and awaits future development.   References : 1. Gramfort, A. et al. MNE software for processing MEG and EEG data. Neuroimage 86, 446 -460 (2014).  2.

      "Content: Mapping Cortical Activations Underlying Speech Processing Across Development via Simultaneous fMRI-fNIRS  S. Sanchez -Alonsoa, R.R. Canaleb, I. Nichosonc, V. Chambersa, and R.N. Aslina,b,d   aChild Study Center,  New Haven, CT, USA, bDepartment  of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, Department of Psychology, Tulane University, LA, USA,  dDepartment of Psychology, Y ale University, New Haven, CT  USA Presenting Author email address: sara.sanchez.alonso@yale.edu  Abstract:  Speech processing in the adult brain has been associated with a  set of left -lateralized fronto -temporal language regions. Importantly, the developmental changes that lead to this mature  language system  remain understudied. We report fMRI -fNIRS signals from  a language localizer task in 40 young adults using our previously -validated simultaneous  data collection protocol (Sanchez -Alonso et . al., 2023). In turn, we are collecting data  from children aged 5 -to-7 years old using the same simultaneous fMRI -fNIRS approach and a naturalistic language localizer task.  Collectively, these data aim to validate fNIRS as a readily accessible and cost -effective tool for future developmental studies of the language system.  Introduction:  A fronto -temporal language system  engaged in speech processing and language comprehension has long been characterized in the adult brain. It is unclear, however, how these  language regions develop and what type of structural and functional developmental changes lead to the mature  language system . Partly, this is due to the challenges of conducting longitudinal functional mag netic resonance  imaging ( fMRI ) studies with pediatric samples. A more versatile tool to study brain function in young children is functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) due to its portability, ease of implementation in naturalistic settings and robustness to motion relative to fMRI. However, it is unclear to what extent  classical language  areas can be capture d with fNIRS . Therefore , studies assessing the correspondence between fMRI and fNIRS modalities using traditional language  localizers are needed to validate fNIRS as an accessible tool for developmental studies of the language system. To address this gap , we report two studies  that assess  the correspondence  across simultaneously -collected fMRI and fNIRS signals using language localizer paradigms .  The overall goal is to  assess  the feasibility of implementing fNIRS  to probe the language system in infants  and young children.  Methods: Study 1  (data collection complete) : We collected simultaneous fMRI (Siemens 3T PRISMA) and fNIRS (NIRx NIRScout -XP) signals in 40 young adults (18 - to 35 -year-olds) us ing a  previously -validated language  localizer task (Binder et al., 2011 ). Study 2  (ongoing ): Simultaneous fMRI -fNIRS signals are currently being collected from a group of young children (5- to 7-year-olds) (target n= 25) using a naturalistic language localizer task . This naturalistic paradigm consists of 20 -sec child -friendly clips that contrast speech vs nonspeech (i.e., time -reversed speech) conditions.   Data preprocessing:  The fNIRS data are preprocessed  using  NeuroDOT  (Eggebrecth & Culver, 2019 ) to create anatomically registered maps of cerebral hemodynamic s. Image reconstruction steps include mapping optode locations to  the individual anatomical images, implementing  the light model , and running 3D image reconstruction on CIFTI surface maps. In addition, we use d eight short -separation fNIRS channels to measure and remove extracerebral signals. The fMRI data are preprocessed via Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipelines (Glasser et al., 2013) , which include the latest denoising approaches and surface mapping methods. For scalp -to-anatomy co -registration of the fNIRS signal, we use  a direct mapping of optode locations to the T1w image via vitamin E capsules  on the fNIRS caps at each optode location . A key innovation is co -registration of fNIRS channels to the individual’s cortical surface (i.e., a CIFTI surface map), and co -registration of fMRI voxels using the HCP MMP 1.0 atlas (Glasser et al., 2016)  and subsequent cortical parcellation, which consists of 180 cortical areas per hemisphere.  Results: Results from the adult sample ( Study 1 ) show that , similar to fMRI, fNIRS signal s recruit  canonical  language regions in fronto -temporal cortices  with lateralization to the left hemisphere . We show that decreases  in deoxygenated hemoglobin in image reconstructed fNIRS signals coincide with BOLD -positive regions in language  cortex areas . Ongoing quantitative analyses of the two signals consist of assessing the timeseries  temporal correlation across fMRI and fNIRS  as a function of cortical region, location of the fNIRS probe s, and implementation of different smoothing parameters during fMRI data preprocessing . Data collection of the developmental sample ( Study 2 ) is ongoing  and will be preprocessed following the same workflow as described for the adult sample  in Study 1 .  Conclusion : Our study  provide s a comparison of fMRI and fNIRS signals collected simultaneously from the same subjects  and shows that fNIRS can be used to investigate  cortical activations underlying speech processing during a traditional language localizer task . Ongoing data collection with a developmental sample will shed light on the feasibility of implementing fNIRS and naturalistic imaging paradigms to study the language system in young children.   19 of 398\n",

      "Content: Establishing Responsible Standards in fNIRS Research through International Data Governance   Aleksandra Landowska, Damian Eke, Max L. Wilson , Horia A. Maior  School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK   Presenting Author email address: aleksandra.landowska@nottingham.ac.uk   Abstract:  Our research aims to  develop and implement International Data Governance guidelines for fNIRS through Responsible Research and Innovation workshops , to establish a framework for ethical, legal, and secure management of fNIRS data internationally. The lack of an established IDG framework highlights the need for a standardised approach that ensures responsible fNIRS data use, respecting international reg ulations and ethical norms. We further employ qualitative methods for data collection and analysis  to finalise th e definitions of the guidelines for fNIRS . This initiative unites fNIRS  developers, researchers, and policymakers to enhance ethical standards and promote international neuroscience collaboration.   Introduction:  The design and use of fNIRS, like many technologies, raise s ethical concerns including privacy, confidentiality, informed consent, and the potential for dual use of concern.  Despite its importance, data governance has received limited attention in the fNIRS communit y1, underscoring the need for comprehensive guidelines that address data -sharing, ethical, and legal challenges.  Moreover, th e recent advancements in AI highlight the importance for fNIRS data governance within a contex t of AI application.  Our research aims to  develop International Data Governance (IDG) guidelines for fNIRS  research  and to establish principles and practices for the ethical, legal, and secure sharing and management of neuroscience data internationally. Although there are some existing standards regarding fNIRS data management  and sharing such as BIDS2, there is a lack of international data governance framework t hat would ensure  responsible, ethical norms , and regulations for fNIRS data.    Methods: Our workshop method  employ s the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework , and more specifically the RRI Prompts and Practice Cards3 to develop IDG for fNIRS . The RRI framework introduces concepts and scenarios designed to encourage reflection on the ethical, social, and environmental implications of research projects.  The 2-hour workshops  are being  held online to bring together an international community of stakeholders, such as fNIRS  hardware and software developers, researchers, and experts in brain data governance. The main objectives of the workshop are to familiarize the fNIRS community with the RRI framework and to create targeted IDG guidelines specifically for fNIRS. These guid elines aim to standardize protocols to tackle common data governance issues such as data privacy, bias, equitable access, and international sharing, ensuring adherence to international regulations and ethical standards. Recordings of the workshops are bein g analysed  qualitatively  using  Thematic Analysis4 to further inform the final definition  of fNIRS -focused  IDG guidelines.   Conclusions: This initiative strives to enhance international ethical standards, improve data sharing practices, and foster scientific innovation and collaboration across the global fNIRS and broader neuroscience communities. Through this collaborative effort, the glob al fNIRS community is working together to cultivate a more ethical, secure, and cooperative future in neuroscience research and innovation.  We expect to be able to present initial results  and recommendations  from  these workshops  at the conference.   References:  1. Eke, D. O. (2022). International data governance for neuroscience.

School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK  Presenting Author email address: aabdalma@uwo.ca  (#These authors contributed equally to the work )  Abstract:  In a series of studies, we evaluated whether  fNIRS can detect  sensory  and command -drive n neural processing in healthy participants and in behaviourally non -responsive patients.  At the individual level, we demonstrate that fNIRS can detect commonly studied resting state networks, sensorimotor processing, speech  perception , and command -driven brain activity. Testing fNIRS with three acutely unresponsive patients , we found that one  could willfully modulate their brain activity  – providing evidence of preserved consciousness despite no observable behavioural signs of awareness. Th ese promising res ults highlight the potential of fNIRS as a tool for uncovering hidden cognitive states in critical care settings.   Introduction:  Recent advancements in functional neuroimaging have demonstrated that some unresponsive patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) retain a level of consciousness that is inconsistent with their behavioural diagnosis of awareness. However, current neuroimaging methods – such as fMRI and EEG – are often impractical to use with this population of patients. fNIRS is a promising alternative ; however, its sensitivity  for detecting the neural correlates of consciousness remains to be established.  In this series of  studies,  we explore whether fNIRS can reliably identify neural correlates of consciousness processing  in healthy participants at the individual -participant level using a sequence  of validated fMRI paradigms . We then use these methods to assess brain activity in acutely unresponsive patients in the ICU.    Methods: A well -established hierarchical paradigm was used to assess basic sensory and higher -level brain function. Specifically, we evaluated neural activity at rest to assess resting -state connectivity, during passive stimulus -based paradigm s assessing sensorimotor processing  (median nerve stimulation) and speech  perceptio n (pseudo -words  and short stories), and during two active tasks (motor imagery and spatial navigation).  A total of 118 datasets were collected from healthy participants across all tasks (age range 20 -48, 62 datasets from females ). Three  acutely unresponsive patients with severe brain injury were also  recruited from the  ICU and assessed with the same tasks. Resting state data was collected for six minutes while task -based paradigms were conducted in a block design with alternating 30 -s cycles of task and rest for a total experiment time ranging from five to fifteen minutes depending on the task. A n fNIRS system with 32 sources and 32 detectors  (NIRScoutXP , NIRx Medical Technologies, LLC) was used with 121 long channels and 8 short channels, providing coverage of the frontal, parietal and temporal regions. The data was corrected for motion artifacts, band -pass filtered , and short channels were regressed in the GLM framework to reduce the effects of systemic physiological noise . For resting state, the time series were pre -whitened and seed -based analysis was used to extract resting state networks. For task -based paradigms, single -level and group -level analys es were conducted to determine the sensitivity of fNIRS to detecting brain activity to each task. A channel was deemed activated  if there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in oxy - and a concurrent decrease in deoxyhe moglobin.   Results: Common resting state networks  were detected in all participants with the frontoparietal and default mode  network s showing the highest degree of similarity across participants ( 74%). The sensitivity to the sensorimotor , speech perception , motor imagery and spatial navigation tasks was 88.3%, 82.8%, 62.5% and 33.3% , respectively.  These results, except for spatial navigation, are in agreement with previous fMRI studies. The low sensitivity to spatial navigation is likely due to  lack of sensitivity to the parahippocampal gyrus . Of the three patients, one showed activity across all tasks that was indistinguishable from healthy controls, suggesting that this patient  had a level of conscious that was entirely inconsistent with their behavioural assessment of awareness .    Conclusion:  This study is the culmination of 4 years of data collection and analysis , where we demonstrated for the first time, the ability of fNIRS to detect residual  and covert  brain function in patients with severe brain injury  using a hierarchical approach . Current work aims at increasing the sample size to better assess the sensitivity and specificity of our approach in patient population. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a multimodal approach to predict prognosis following a severe brain injury within the first few days of admission to the ICU . 61 of 398\n",

Vollenweider5  1 Neurophotonics and Biosignal Processing Research Group, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; 2 Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland 3 Department of Adult Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Psychiatric University Clinic Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland 4 Neuroscience Center Zurich (ZNZ), University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland 5 University Hospital of Psychiatry, University of Zurich, Neuropsychopharmacology and Brain Imaging, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Zurich, Switzerland Presenting author (*) email address: Felix.Scholkmann@usz.ch  Abstract:  In our contribution, we summarise the current status and provide an outlook on the great potential of using optical neuroimaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate changes in brain activity induced by psychedelics.   Introduction:  Psychedelics (such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin or dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) are psychoactive compounds that induce an altered state of consciousness characterised by changes in perception, mood, cognition and self-awareness. The effects of psychedelics on the human brain have been studied since the 1950s, primarily with electroencephalography at first, then with other neuroimaging techniques. Basic research into the effects of psychedelics on humans is currently experiencing a resurgence, largely due to growing confirmation of the therapeutic promise of psychedelics.  Methods: In our contribution, we provide an overview of current neuroimaging research on psychedelics in humans, with a particular focus on fNIRS studies conducted to date and the great potential of fNIRS for this type of research.  Results: To date, two fNIRS studies have been published on the effects of psychedelics in humans: our 2019 single-subject pilot study investigating the effects of psilocybin (17 mg) [1]; and a 2023 study investigating the effects of sub-anaesthetic ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) [2]. Changes in functional connectivity were observed in both studies.  Conclusion:  We believe that now is the time to capitalise on the momentum of the current resurgence of research into the effects of psychedelics as well as the increasing advancement and popularity of the fNIRS technique to establish fNIRS in psychedelic research.

      "Content: Optimizing spatial specificity and signal quality in fNIRS: An overview of potential challenges and possible options for improving reliability in real -time applications   Franziska Klein  Biomedical Devices and Systems Group, R&D Division Health, OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Germany   franziska.klein@offis.de   Abstract:  fNIRS offers great potential for real -time applications such as neurofeedback (NFB) and brain -computer interfaces (BCIs).  The aim here is to discuss the potential challenges and possible option for improvement, with a focus on increasing spatial specificity and signal quality to enhance the reliability, reproducibility,  and repeatability of future fNIRS -based real -time applications. Topics include challenges in probe design, cap placement, and validation using high -resolution techniques such as fMRI to improve spatial specificity. In addition, strategies to improve signa l quality, including methods to reduce noise such as motion artifacts and correct extracerebral systemic activity in the context of real -time processing, are discussed.   Introduction : In recent years, fNIRS has emerged as a promising tool for real -time applications such as NFB and BCIs. Compared to fMRI, fNIRS offers advantages such as portability, lower cost, enabling hemodynamic measurements in real -world environments, from bedsides to patients' homes. However, using fNIRS in real time presents challenges, including ensuring consistent spatial specificity and maintaining high signal quality. Furthermore, real-time fNIRS applications lag behind offline methods in terms of development, validation, standardization and reporting, making data interpretation and reproducibility difficult. This methodologically focused overview  [1] discusses possible  options for  improvements in spatial specificity and signal quality that will be important for improving the reliability and effectiveness of  future  fNIRS -based real-time applications.   Topics: Two important aspects for improving fNIRS -based real -time applications are discussed: improving spatial specificity ( cf. Fig. 1) and signal quality ( cf. Fig. 2). In this context, potenti al challenges,  and possible options regarding their applicability in real-time contexts are considered . Regarding spatial specificity, discussions focus on probe design, cap placement, and spatial validation using high -resolution methods such as fMRI. These factors are important for accurate and repeatable targeting of specific brain regions.  To ensure that real -time applications are based on brain activity and not noise, robust  signal quality is essential.  Regarding signal quality  improvement , possible  algorithms that can be applied in real time, from signal quality assessment to noise reduction such as motion artifacts and extracerebral systemic activity , are considered .   Conclusion:  High spatial specificity and robust signal quality are important factors for the effectiveness and reliability of real -time fNIRS -based applications. Failure to take these aspects into account could have a direct impact on the reliability of the signal and  therefore on users' trust in these technologies.  Continuous development and rigorous validation of real -time methods are important for further development and ensuring their applicability in both clinical and research settings . In this context, the aim of this overview is to initiate an improvement and further development of future fNIRS -based real-time applications  and methodology  regarding  spatial specificity and signal quality in order to increase their reliability, reproducibility and repeatability.

      "Content: Semantic memory for brand -name products: The view from tensor decomposition of the fNIRS signal  Terrence M. Barnhardta*, Jasmine Y. Chana, Teresa Wilcoxa, and Behnaz Ghoraanib aDepartment of Psychology Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, USA  bDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, USA  *Presenting Author email address: tbarnhardt@fau.edu   Abstract:  Tensor decomposition  was used to examine the impact of semantic categorization of brand name products on blood flow in the left and right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior temporal lobe (ATL) during a study phase and again in a test phase in which the previously categorized products were presented for a purchase decision. Results showed that categorization in the study phase resulted in relatively greater hemodynamic activity in all regions and relatively less hemodynamic activity during the test  phase , but only in the left ATL . These findings suggest that tensor decomposition is a feasible approach to analyzing fNIRS signals.  Introduction:  Semantic memory is our permanent store of concepts and categories , such as birds and phones. In this exploratory work, fNIRS was used to investigate whether recent advances in the cognitive neuroscience of semantic memory can illuminate priming effects in consumer psychology, with a specific focus on how brand -name product categorization primes purchase intention. In order  to explicate the fNIRS signal, tensor decomposition (TD) was used. TD examines the simultaneous impact of time, space, and experimental conditions on the fNIR S signal in order to statistically determin e those time -of-interest (TOI) , region -of-interest (ROI) , and condition combinations (i.e., components) that make up the totality of the hemodynamic signal.  Findings from this research can enhance our understanding of the neural basis of semantic memory for brand -name products, with implications for cognitive, consumer, and clinical neuroscience.  Method: There were three conditions in the study task. In the Semantic Comparison (SC) condition, a categorization cue was presented (e.g., “Body part ”) and participants chose the product  picture at the bottom of the screen (e.g., Steve Madden Heels  and Wilson Tennis Racket) that matched the product picture at the top of the screen (e.g., Callaway Golf Shoes) on that cue. In the Same condition, a “Same” cue was presented and the same Steve Madden Heels picture was presented  at the top of screen . In the Similar condition, a “Similar” cue was presented and a Prada Heels picture was presented  at the top of the screen . Later, in the test task, Steve Madden Heels was paired with Prada Heels and participants chose the product they would purchase . At test, a control condition was included in which neither product had been previously studied. After the fNIRS  signal was pre process ed, a 3-way tensor with temporal, spatial, and conditions factors was constructed for each hemisphere for the study phase and again for the test phase.  Canonical polyadic decomposition, a form of TD, was used to compress the fNIRS signal and extract the tempor al x spatial x condition components that represented the signal.  Results: In both hemispheres, at both study and test, the first component identified in the TD analysis accounted for 60-70% of the hemodynamic signal.  For the study phase, a  3×2 (Condition ×Hemisphere) RMANOV A on the spatial ×subject weights in the first component s revealed a main effect of Condition , F(2,96)=3.92, MSE =1.313, p=.024, partial eta2=.075 (SC=.19, Similar= -.01, Same=.05).  For the test phase, a  4×2 (Condition ×Hemisphere) RMANOV A on the spatial ×subject weights in the first components revealed a 2 -way interaction , F(3,144)=2.93, MSE =1.384, p=.046, partial eta2 = .058 , such that the spatial ×subject weights in the SC condition was less than in the Same condition , but only in the left hemisphere  (Left: SC= -.22, Same=.03; R ight: SC= -.01, Same=.01) .  Conclusion:  Very little work has been done on brand -name products with semantic memory in mind and very little work has been done on the neural organization of semantic memory with brand -name products in mind . The present work targeted this neglected intersection  between brand -name products and the neural organization of semantic memory . There were three surprising findings: the effect of categorization at study in all ROI’s (including the right LPFC ), the carryover of the categorization effect in the left ATL at test (as shown by  a relative decrease in hemodynamic response ), and the lack of a similar categorization carryover effect in the right ATL at test.  These results demonstrate that fNIRS can be used to explore the neural basis of semantic memory and can also contribute to the emerging field of consumer neuroscience.  The results indicate that the type of processing called for in the Semantic Comparison condition engaged the semantic system more than the type of processing called for in the other  condition s and had a longer -lasting effect on the conceptualization of brand -name products. Finally, these results also demonstrate d the viability  of the tensor decomposition (TD) approach to fNIRS signal analysis.  254 of 398\n",

While Neuro -linguistic Programming (NLP) shows promise in addressing these issues, its mechanism s remain unexplored  from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. This study investigates the efficacy of NLP in stress and anxiety management, focusing on attention and memory effects. Employing a mixed -method approach with Functio nal Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), neural correlates associated with stress and anxiety are explored. Pre - and post -test assessments on  participants reveal potential neural patterns and communication strategies' effectiveness.  This study paves the way  for future research combining linguistics and neuroscience for improved therapeutic approaches.   Introduction:  Stress and anxiety are prevalent mental health issues impacting people's overall well -being  (World Health Organization, 2021) . NLP has emerged as a potential treatment, but its effectiveness in managing these conditions remains unclear from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. This research aims to explore t he role of NLP by investigating t he impact of stress and anxiety on attention and memory and t he effectiveness of NLP communication strategies in managing them .   Methods:  Thirty participants expe riencing stress and anxiety underwent  pre-and post-test assessments using  Functi onal Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Participants in the experimental group were  engage d in NLP -based interventions, and communication strategies employed by  practitioners were also analyzed. Data was collected  to explore neural correlates as sociated with stress and anxiety, focusing on attention and memory effe cts. A mixed -method approach has been  employed t o triangulate neural findings with the linguistic findings , which provides a comprehensive insight  into the efficacy  of NLP in stress and anxiety management.   Results: Preliminary analyse s showed that BA -10 which is particularly involved in working memory was the least activated area  in some participants having stress and anxiety.  The findings reveal significant improvements in stress and anxiety levels post -NLP intervention. fNIRS data indicate notable changes in neural activity, particularly in regions associated with attention and memory.   Conclusion:  The study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of Neuro -linguistic Programming (NLP) in managing stress and anxiety from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) data reveal s distinct neural patterns associated with stress and anxiety reduction following NLP interventions.  Additionally, the study shed s light on the linguistic mechanisms underlying NLP's success. By bridging the gap between linguistics and neuroscience, this research will pave the way for future studies and therapeutic approaches that combine these powerful areas of knowledge.   1- World Hea lth Organization (2021).

      "Content: Real-time Brain -Computer Interface based on fNIRS   Eunji Won1, Seongyeon Lim1, Suh-Yeon Dong2  1Dept. of Information Technology Engineering, Sookmyung Women’s University, Seoul, 04310, Republic of Korea  2Div. of Artificial Intelligence Engineering, Sookmyung Women’s University, Seoul, 04310, Republic of Korea  Presenting Author email address:  sydong@sookmyung.ac.kr   Abstract:  This study proposes a real -time Brain -Computer Interface (BCI) system based on functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). W e implemented a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm with stimuli presentation times under one second. Using Lab Streaming Layer, we can record markers of stimuli presentation and participant responses directly onto the fNIRS signal in real-time. We demonstrated the system's ability to distinguish between rare target and non -target s. This preliminary research substantiates the potential for applying  fNIRS -based BCI systems into environments requiring rapid stimulus presentation.   Introduction: Recent advances in brain -computer interfaces (BCIs) have sparked significant interest in developing systems that can interact directly with neural activity in real -time [1]. Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising mo dality for BCI. Despite its potential, it has been limited its usage in BCIs  due to the low temporal resolution of fNIRS caused by the time delay of the hemodynamic response  [2]. This study introduces a novel real -time fNIRS -based BCI system designed to op erate a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm where stimuli are presented at sub -second intervals. Our primary objective is to demonstrate the system's ability to accurately differentiate between infrequent target and non -target stimuli rapidly,  a crucial capability for applications requiring quick response times and high levels of accuracy. This preliminary study of rapid processing in fNIRS -based BCI systems could significantly broaden their applicability in various real -world scenarios.  Methods: We adapted the discrimination/selection response (DSR) task from Shin et al. [3], modifying it for a RSVP paradigm . We partitioned the DSR task into separate target and non -target sequences , with an extended inter-stimulus stimulus  to facilitate t he distinct detection of responses to each.  fNIRS data were collected using the NIRSport2 system  (NIRx Medizintechnik GmbH, Germany ), allowing for enhanced detection and discrimination of neural correlates associated with the task.  Moreover, the recording software (Aurora fNIRS, NIRx Medizintechnik GmbH, Germany ) is synchronized with the task presentation software (PsychoPy, v2023.1.3) via Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) , to record and analyze the markers of stimuli and responses directly from the fNIRS signals  (see Figure 1) .  Results: In this preliminary study, four female healthy individuals participated (ages: 25.75 ±2.05 years ). At the end of each sequence, participants were asked to respond the presence of a target. The implemented system successfully captured markers for sequence  initiation and conclusion, along with the participants’ responses, directly into the fNIRS dataset in the Aurora software.  By comparing the concentration changes of the oxygenated hemoglobin  between target and non -target sequences, we could observe a noticeable difference in the hemodynamic responses  in real -time.  Conclusion:  Our proposed  system demonstrated the capability for real -time tracking of hemodynamic responses, well-aligned with the task presentation. Early analysis indicates the system's improved precision in differentiating neural activity associated with target versus  non-target stimuli. This proficiency signals promising enhancements in fNIRS -based BCI technology for more responsive and wider  applications.  References : 1. Netzer, E., Frid, A., and Feldman, D.

      "Content: Cerebral blood flow response to functional stimuli assessed by interferometric  diffuse correlation spectroscopy      Mitchell B. Robinsona, Bin Denga, Ailis Muldoona, Shakeeb Habasha, Maria Angela Franceschinia, Stefan A. Carpa  aAthinoula  A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States  mitchell.robinson@mgh.harvard.edu   Abstract:  To date, the majority of  non-invasive functional imaging has utilized signals based on hemoglobin contrast (fNIRS, fMRI). Previous work has documented that responses in microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) to functional stimuli are greater than functional responses in cerebral hemoglobin concentration, though portable and non -invasive instrumentation able to measure CBF wi th sufficient SNR and head coverage have been prohibitively expensive.  To address this, we have developed a functional perfusion imaging system based on interferometric  diffuse correlation spectroscopy. In this work, we compare CBF and hemoglobin concentration responses to functional stimuli and demonstrate the feasibility of functional perfusion imaging.   Introduction:  Most optical neuroimaging studies in humans have been based on measuring changes in hemoglobin concentration (functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS))1, though functional changes in blood flow greatly exceed the changes in the hemoglobin concentration response2,3. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a comparable NIR optical method that assesses blood flow in tissue, though traditional DCS has insufficient SNR at optode spacings where brain sensitivity is sufficient for adequate measurements4. Recent advances i n DCS technology have enabled improved DCS instruments capable of measuring with both high SNR and high cerebral sensitivity, enabling functional perfusion imaging.  Methods: A multichannel interferometric DCS (iDCS) system  (Figure 1)  adapted from a previously developed single channel system5 is compared to a commercial fNIRS (NIRX Scout) instrument in the assessment of hemodynamic responses to functional stimuli. Motor (finger tapping) and cognitive (mental subtraction) tasks are performed. A common optode design allow s for back -to-back testing.  A GLM analysis framework is then  used to derive functional responses to stimuli.  Results: fiDCS demonstrated localized blood flow changes in the motor cortex area during a contralateral (but not ipsilateral) finger tapping task. Ongoing work is focusing on characterizing the response to cognitive stimuli and comparing perfusion vs hemoglobin response s in conjunction with co -located sequential fNIRS measurements using an NIRx Scout imaging system.  Conclusion:  The improved SNR of our 1064 nm  interferometric DCS instrument allow s for measurements at 3.1 cm inter-optode distance at a sampling rate of 5 Hz. The additional information provided by cerebral blood flow changes has the potential to enable a more complete view of metabolic response for functional brain imaging.   1. Pinti, P. et al.
