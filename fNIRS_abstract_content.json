Our results show that both  autistic and non -autistic school -age children tolerate \nHD-DOT , and HD-DOT is sensitive to autism -associated differences in brain function . \nIntroduction:  Recent advances in functional brain imaging show promise to provide valuable  biomarkers of autism \nspectrum disorder (ASD)  diagnostic likelihood  and behavioral trait severity. However, traditional neuroimaging \nmodalities such as  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) require participants to remain still in a loud, \nconfined environment, posing difficulties for children, particularly those with ASD. Herein, we aimed to establish the \nfeasibility of high-density diffuse optical tomography (H D-DOT ) [1], a minimally constraining optical neuroimaging \nmodality that can map brain function in an open and naturalistic environment,  to assess brain function in ASD  and \nnon-autistic control (NAC) children using a biological motion perception paradigm  [2]. \nMethods: We imaged 46 ASD children age 7 -18 years , 49 NAC , and 17 pro band siblings as they viewed coherent \nand scrambled movie clips  of point -light biological motion . The HD -DOT instrument contain ed a dense array of 96 \nsources and 92 detectors that support  >1,200 overlapping measurements  within 4cm  per wavelength and provide a \nsmooth sensitivity profile on the cortical surface. Data processing and image reconstruction were performed  using the \nNeuroDOT pipeline in MATLAB  [1]. We assessed data quality using the  pulse signal -to-noise ratio  (SNR) , good \nmeasurements (GM) percentage, and motion levels  with the global variance in the temporal derivative  (GVTD)  [3]. \nWe assessed group -level cortical brain function with statistical \nparametric mapping. Additionally, we tested for brain -behavior \nassociations with dimensional metrics of autis tic traits, as measured \nwith the Social Responsiveness Scale -2 (SRS) , with hierarchical \nregression models.  \nResults: Data quality assessment s revealed  no significant \ndifferences in data quality and motion between ASD and NAC . \nAdditionally, confirming results in fMRI studies, we found that \nNAC participants presented stronger brain activity contrast \n(coherent > scrambled) than ASD children in six cortical regions \nrelated to visual, motor, and social processing. Moreover , \nregression models revealed multiple cortical regions in ASD  \nparticipants where brain function is significantly associated with \ndimensional measures of autis tic traits .  \nConclusion:  This study demonstrates that HD -DOT is sensitive to \nbrain function  that differentiates between NAC and ASD groups \nand correlates with dimensional measures of ASD traits. Overall, \nthis study highlights the effectiveness of HD -DOT as a comparable \ntool to fMRI for studying brain function in autistic children \nthroughout childhood development in a naturalistic setting . \nReferences:  \n[1] Eggebrecht A.

    "Functional speciali sation in the first years of life : \nlongitudinal characterisation of  social perception  with fNIRS\nJ Benerradi  a, C Bulgarelli  b, A Blasi c, B Blanco  a, S McCann  d, B Milosavljevic e, E Mbye f, E Touray f,\nS Moore d, f, C Elwell c, S Lloyd -Fox a, The BRIGHT  Team\na Psychology, University of Cambridge , UK ; b Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London, UK ; \ncMedical  Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London , UK; d Women & Children's Health, King’s College London , UK ; \ne Biological and Behavioural Science s, Queen Mary  University of London, UK ; f The Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia  at the  London \nSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, The Gambia  \nPresenting Author email address:  jb2615@cam.ac.uk  \nAbstract:   By studying brain  response s to social perception longitudinally in infants and children  \nin The Gambia , we found that social vocal stimuli elicit ed a significantly slower and stronger \nresponse than auditory non -vocal stimuli across all 6 age points collected in the  Brain Imaging for \nGlobal Health (BRIGHT)  project from 5 months to 5 years old . We show the advantage of studying \nbrain activation informed by the  speed and magnitude of the response  with functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS)  to characterise the brain response  more comprehensively . \nIntroduction : Infants and children in low- and middle -income countries have historically been under -represented in \nneurodevelopmental research , despite being often exposed to early adversity  which can impact cognitive development.  \nThe Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) project enabled  the collection of a large  dataset  for studying cognitive \ndevelopment  longitudinally  from birth to 5 years old  in The Gambia and UK1. While social processing has been\nstudied often in infants younger than 1 year  of age  in high -income countries , we here present findings with functional \nnear-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) on a social task in the Gambian cohort  from 5 to 60 months . \nMethods: Participants  were presented with social videos  \naccompanied by vocal and non -vocal sounds  following a block \ndesig n; a study paradigm common in previous literature and adapted \nto the local context2. Participants were tested  at 5 months ( N=127 ), 8\nmonths ( N=110), 12 months ( N=116), 18 months ( N=111), 24\nmonths ( N=112) and 60 months ( N=124) with fNIRS  from the\ntemporal and inferior frontal brain regions . Channels with low scalp \ncoupling were pruned and  motion artefacts  corrected using  spline  \ninterpolation  and wavelet  filtering3. The data was converted into oxy -\n(HbO)  and deoxy -haemoglobin  (HbR ), and blocks were averaged for \neach condition ( vocal or non-vocal ). We studied longitudinally  the \naverage time -to-peak  (speed)  and peak amplitude  (magnitude)  of the \nhaemodynamic response function (HRF) , for each condition , which \ninformed  the appropriate time  window to selected for  statistical \nanalysis on  HbO and HbR  to investig ate brain  activation . \nResults: We found  a significantly greater activation  in response to \nvocal  compared to non -vocal  stimuli across all ages, located  \nbilaterally  in temporal regions but also in  the inferior frontal gyr i. \nThis become s more widespread with ag e, with activation on 8 out of \n34 channels at 5 months compared to  21 out of 34 at 60 months  on \nthis vocal minus non -vocal contrast . Furthermore, HbO  and HbR  \nreach ed their peak amplitude significantly slower in response to \nsocial vocal compared to non -vocal stimuli (Fig. 1 ) consistently\nfrom 5 to 60 months (all p -values < 0.05  except HbR  at 60 months  where \np-value < 0.1 ), with the absolute amplitude of the peak  also appear ing to decrease with age up to 24 months .\nConclusion:  Studying  the speed  and magnitude of the response with fNIRS  enabled to have more details about the \nbrain response s to social perception  in infants and children  longitudinally , but also to inform the time  window on \nwhich to focus statistical analysis . Ongoing work is now investigating whether amplitude and time -to-peak change as \na function of the cortical location  to gain further  insight into  the dynamics of the response  across ages . \n1.

To address this, we examined longitudinal \nchanges in visual neurocognition  from infancy to toddlerhood in 6- and 9 -month -old children from \nlow and middle/ high socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds in a large LMIC  cohort. We found \nthat there were developmental changes in both behavioural performance and associated left -\nlateralized parietal activation from infancy to toddlerhood, with mor e robust changes in children \nfrom the high SES 9 -month -old cohort. Our findings contribut e to the growing literature on \nneurocognition in children from LMIC countries.  \nIntroduction : Each year, 250  million children in  LMIC  fail to reach their developmental potential . Despite this, \nthe nature of developmental changes in neurocognitive function in the first 1000 days of life remains under -\nexplored , especially using longitudinal methods. In the current study,  we first examined developmental changes \nin visual neurocognition from infancy to toddlerhood in children in rural India. Second, we inquired whether these \nchanges varied as a function of age and SES. \nMethods:  High and low SES families with  6-month -old and 9 -month -old infants from in and around Shivgarh, \nrural Uttar Pradesh, India  took part in the study  (N=223 infants) . Data were collected from these families  at two \ntime-points.  At the first time -point  during infancy , children were 6 or 9 months of age, and at the second time -\npoint  during toddlerhood , they were 18 or 21 months of age, respectively. Visual cognition  was assessed at both \ntime-points using a preferential looking task. In this task, two side -by-side blinking displays of colored squares \nwere presented, with one side showing a change in colors, while the colors on the other side stayed constant. Load \nwas varied between 1 and 3 items during infancy  and between 2 and 6 items during toddlerhood . Portable eye -\ntracking and video rec ordings were used to extract looking behaviour , and functional near -infrared spectroscopy \nwas used to collect brain function while children  engaged with the task.  Two key measures of visual cognition \nwere extracted – total looking time (TLT) was calculated by summing the total time spent looking at both sides \nand, a change preference (CP) score was calculated by dividing the total time spent looking at the changing side \ndivided by TLT. Image reconstruction techniques were used to transform channel -based neuroimaging data into \nvoxel space  using segmented head volumes obtained from MRI scans . Linear mixed effects modelling was used \nto examine developmental changes and associations with age and SES.  \nResults. Our behavioural results revealed two key interactions involving age and SES. First, there was a positive \nassociation between CP scores during infancy and CP  scores during toddlerhood; however, th is association was \nstronger for high SES children  compared to low SES children . Second , we found that the positive association \nbetween CP scores in infancy and toddlerhood was generally stronger for the 9-month -old cohort  compared to 6 -\nmonth -old cohort , except for the low SES 9 -month -old cohort  with longer TLT. Our brain results revealed \nengagement across canonical regions of the frontoparietal visual cognition network.  There were developmental \nand SES -related effects in  left-lateralized anterior intraparietal sulcus  (laIPS) , a region in the dorsal attention \nnetwork associated with maintaining working memory representations  and impacted by stunting status as \ndemonstrated by our previous work . Specifically, the 9 -month -old cohort showed greater laIPS activation from \ninfancy to toddlerhood, compared to the 6 -month -old cohort. Activation in this region was also associated with \nbehavioural measures : children with better CP scores showed an increase in laIPS activation from infancy to \ntoddlerhood compared to children with lower CP scores.  \nConclusions.  Our findings show that developmental changes in neurocognitive function in the first 1000 days of \nlife are affected by SES and cohort effects, thus, uniquely  contribut ing to the growing literature on neurocognition \nin children from LMIC countries.  4 of 398",
    "Dissecting neural and physiological correlates of affective \nand cognitive empathy in preschoolers \nC. Bulgarelli1, P. Pinti1, T. Bazelmans2 and E.J.H. Jones1\n1Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, UK.\n2Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, UK  \nCorresponding author e -mail address: c.bulgarelli@bbk.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  Unders tanding neural and physiological markers of empathy development is pivotal, yet \nthere are no appropriate tasks to assess them . We designed a new block -design task and measured \nfNIRS and heart rate responses to emotional and neutral scenarios in 43 3 -to-5-year-olds. We found \nthat preschoolers’ network specialisation for empathy is similar to adults, and that heart rate \nsignificantly decreased for negative emotional scenarios. This work may provide insights  into the  \nmechanisms underlying  empathy development and offer  a task for future studies.   \nIntroduction:  Empathy is fundamental for bonds and social interactions1, but mechanisms behind its development \nare unclear. Adult studies suggest that there are two components of empathy, an affective  one (sharing someone else’s \nemotion) , supported by the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) , and a cognitive one \n(understanding someone else’s emotion), supported by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and \ntemporoparietal junction (TPJ)2. Which component develop s first is debated3. Toddlerhood is the appropriate age to \nstudy this, as from 2 years, toddlers differentiate their emotions originated from others ’4. Tasks used so far to assess \nthe development of empathy might not be appropriate, as most \nrelied on children’s verbal skills, and used different scenarios for  \nempath y components . Here  we aim : i)to propose a new task to \nassess neural and physiological markers  of empathy in toddlers; \nii)to explore whether brain regions supporting  empathy in adults\nare activated in toddlers; i ii)to explore any developmental\nchanges in the emerge nce of empathic component s.\nMethods: We designed a new block -design task, in which 3 -to-\n5-year-olds are exposed to emotional (positive and negative) and\nneutral scenarios  and then asked about characters’ emotions . We\nrecorded neural  and physiological responses to these scenarios\nsimultaneously, using fNIRS on  the frontal and temporoparietal\ncortex and  heart rate. fNIRS channels without clear heart -rate\nsignal were pruned using QT -NIRS5, and motion artefacts were\ncorrected with wavelet6. Data were  band -pass filtered , oxygenated \nand deoxygenated blood changes were  analysed with a GLM \napproach.  Data collection is ongoing . \nResults: Preliminary results from 43 3-to-5-year-olds showed: i)activation \nin right MPFC and bilateral  STG for affective empathy; ii)activation in \nbilateral DLPFC and TPJ for cognitive empathy (all p<0.02) (Fig. 1A). \nRight DLPFC activation for cognitive empathy decreased  with age, left \nSTG activation for affective empathy increased  with age (Fig. 1B). There \nwas a significant decrease in heart rate (greater interbeat interval)  for \nnegative emotional events, compared to the scenario set -up (Fig. 2). \nConclusion: . Regions activated by affective and cognitive empathy in \npreschoolers are consistent with the adult ones2, suggesting networks specialisation to empathy already at preschool \nage. There seems to be an effect of age, which may suggest that affective empathy develops after cognitive empathy . \nThe decreased hear rate only for negative emotional scenarios sugges ts that the first physiological empathic reactions \nmight arise for others’ negative emotions . This new task to assess neural and physiological responses of empathy in \npreschoolers  can be used in future studies. Next steps involve using more sophisticated analysis to investigate the \neffect of age and gender on these responses, and including physiological and neural responses in a unique GLM model.  \n1.Bernhardt, Singer.

    "Developmental Alterations in Brain Network Asymmetry in \n3-9 Month Infants with Congenital Sensorineural Hearing Loss  \n \nZhenyan Hu1,†, Guangfang Liu1,†, Xin Zhou2,†, Yidi Liu2, Endi Huo1, Heather Bortfeld3, \nHaihong Liu 2, *, Haijing Niu1,* \n \n1State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning  Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China,  \n2 Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's \nHealth, Beijing, China  \n3University of California, Merced, Departments of Psychological Sciences and Cognitive and Information Sciences  California, United States  \n†These authors contributed equally to this work  \n*Corresponding Author: Haijing  Niu, E -mail: niuhjing@bnu.edu.cn ; Haihong Liu, Email: haihongliu6@aliyun.com  \n \nAbstract:  Auditory exposure is crucial  for brain development and the generation  of functional \nnetwork lateralization . However, whether and how an initial lack of auditory exposure in early \ninfancy may disrupt the development of functional network lateralization  remains unknown . Using \nresting -state functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we constructed hemispheric functional \nnetwork s based on graph theory  and observed disrupted asymmetrical developmental patterns on \nglobal, local, and nodal frontal efficiencies in infants aged 3 -9 months  with con genital sensorineural \nhearing loss (SNHL).  These findings  highlight  the significance of  auditory exposure for early \nmultisensory functional integration.  \n \nIntroduction:  Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most prevalent congenital sensory deficit in neonates. \nHemispheric asymmetry  is considered one of the cardinal features of human brain development  and the asymmetry of \nfunctional network organization  has been shown to be associated with early development.  While atypical hemispheric \nasymmetry has been observed in individuals with congenital hearing loss during adolescence or adulthood , it remains \nunclear how this asymmetry develops in infants with congen ital SNHL . This study aims to explore the asymmetrical \ndevelopmental trajectories of functional cortical networks in SNHL infants aged 3 -9 months.  The findings will \nenhance our understanding of cortical development across two hemispheres in congenital SNHL infants.  \n \nMethods: In this study, resting -state fNIRS data were collected  from 52 SNHL infants aged 3 -9 months and 60 age -\nmatched typically developing (TD) infants . Subsequently, hemispheric functional networks were constructed and the \ntopological network efficiencies (i.e., global, local, and nodal efficiencies) as well as the efficiency asymmetry index \n(AI) were computed using graph theory approaches . Then, the AI of global , local or nodal efficiency was assessed for \nage-related changes in both groups using general linear models (GLM). Finally, correlations between age and AI of \nnetwork efficiencies were calculated to elucidate developmental trajector y details . \n \nResults: The asymmetrical developmental trajectories of the two groups were significantly different , with a significant \ngroup × age interaction for AI of global efficiency (p = 0.022) and marginally significant interactions for AI of local \nefficiency (p =0.064) and frontal nodal efficiency (p =0.078). Further analysis revealed the TD infants showed \nsignificant developmental increases in AI of \nglobal efficiency (r = 0.31, p =0.015) and \nnodal frontal efficiency (r = 0.35, p = 0.007), \nand a trend towards an i ncrease in AI local \nefficiency (r = 0.21, p =0.099). Nevertheless, \nthe SHNL infants did not show any \ndevelopmental changes in any efficiency AI \nmeasures.  \n \nConclusion:  In summary, the current study  \nsuggests that SNHL infants exhibit disrupted \ndevelopment of cortical lateralization in \nfunctional network organization .

    "Minions and inhibitory control: A go- no-go task predicts \nrisk status in toddlers with and without familial history of \nADHD  \nHenry, M., Patton, S., & Kerr- German, A.N., PhD \nMercer University - College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  \n1501 Mercer University Dr. Macon, GA 31207  \nPresenting Author email address: mayahenry128@gmail.com  \n \nAbstract: The neural underpinnings of task related inhibitory control  are poorly understood in \ntoddlers. Specifically , few studies  have explored  how difference s in neural dynamics in toddlerhood \ngive rise to change s in behavior over early development . 204 children aged  2-5 years old were tested \nvia a minion go -no-go during simultaneous fNIRS recording over bilateral frontal -temporal -and \nparietal cortex. Results revealed children at risk for ADHD  recruited  bilateral frontal cortex more \nstrongly and demonstrated greater  integration of bilateral frontal and parietal cortex compared to \ntypically developing c hildren in this age range . Th ese data  suggest this task may benefit  \nneurocognitive screening for neural indicators of inhibitory control  difficulties.   \n \nIntroduction: The neural underpinnings of task related inhibitory control  are poorly understood in typically \ndeveloping toddlers. Further, th e specific neural dynamics in children at risk for ADHD  are unclear in relation to \nchanges  in behavior over early development within this population. The current study aims to investigate how \nperformance is related to activation in bilateral frontal -temporal -parietal cortex cross -sectionally from 2 to 5 years old \nduring a single scalable paradigm of inhibitory control.  \nMethods:  204 children ages 2 to 5 years  old were recruited for the current study. Temperament  (ECBQ , CBQ ) and \nbehavior  (MAP -DB and SDQ ) were  assessed via parental report to characterize children beyond performance and \nfamilial risk.  Hemodynamic data was collected \ncontinuously during a “Go, No -Go\" computer -based \ntask where engaging stimuli (yellow and purple \nminions) were deployed  (Figure 1.C). A total of four \ncompletely counterbalanced high - and low -frequency \nblocks were administered over the course of 10 \nminutes. Children’s accuracy and reaction time were \ncalculated,  and statistics were run on both behavioral \nand neural outputs to assess the relationship between \nactivation, risk status, and performance.  \nResults: The behavioral results demonstrated  a \nsignificant difference in GNG response time  (Figure 1.B) and accuracy  (Figure 1.A) between the at  risk and typically \ndeveloping  (TD)  groups  specific to commission errors when controlling for developmental gains (i.e., age). Activation \nand recruitment differed between groups for high frequency blocks ; specific to left frontal  (lFC) and bilateral parietal  \ncortices  (PC) in addition to left temporal parietal junction  (TPJ) . These data r evealed  a pattern  of more widespread PC \nrecruitment in TD children while those at risk for ADHD relied on PC in both hemispheres  and only the right TPJ . \nTD children displayed similar rTPJ activation, but this was accompanied by  left TPJ. Both groups displayed lFC \nactivation , but at-risk children exhibited  additional engagement between left frontal and parietal cortices . \nConclusion:  Detection of cortical differences in TD children versus children at -risk may allow for early detection of  \nADHD signs. Th e identification of these distinct neural profiles can then be utilized by clinicians as a potential \ndiagno stic tool before DSM criteria are applicable , as many  developmental delays  characteristic of ADHD  are difficult \nto distinguish before children are fully immersed in a school setting.   \n7 of 398",
    "Sensing via white matter – implanted fNIRS  \n \nNetaniel Rein1,2, Revital Shechter3, Mordekhay Medvedovsky 1,2 and Michal Balberg3, \n \n1Department of Neurology and Agnes Ginges Center for Human Neurogenetics,  \nHadassah Medical Organization, Jerusalem, Israel  \n2The Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel  \n3 Faculty of Electri cal Engineering , Holon Institute of Technology, Holon, Israel  \nbalbergm@hit.ac.il  \n \nAbstract:  Depth electrodes, sensing electric fields, are commonly inserted into the brain of patients \nwith epilepsy to determine the location of the epileptogenic zone. We inserted  a  light source within \nsuch a depth electrode  using an optical fiber with a diffuser . Consequently , all the light reaching a \ndetector, positioned outside the brain, propagates through the white matter (WM). Monte -Carlo \nsimulations of a 5 layers brain model with an implanted light source demonstrate that the maximal \ndetectable distance between the source and  the detector depends on the scattering properties of WM.  \n \nIntroduction:  Non-invasive optical sensors applied to the scalp detect hemodynamic fluctuations in the brain. \nHowever, the depth of penetration is limited to the outer cortical layers due to physical and safety constraints.  \nEpilepsy patients with drug resistant epilepsy may undergo stereo -EEG (SEEG) evaluation, with depth -electrodes \nimplanted into the parenchyma through the skull, for days [1]. These electrodes are applied to localize the \nepileptogenic zone, which can then be  treated with resection or ablation. However, electric fields from closer sources \nmight obscure those from the epileptogenic zone, creating a \"tunnel vision\" effect.  \nNear -infrared light waves naturally diffuse in tissue, which enables detection of changes in blood flow related to \nepileptic activity further away from the electrode. We’ve developed an implanted fNIRS (ifNIRS) sensor with optical \nfibers embedded inside a depth -electrode. This integration offers benefi ts such as eliminating interference by scalp \nblood flow, deeper penetration, and reduced motion artifacts When the light source is implanted within the white \nmatter (WM), and the detectors are placed inside the skull (inside the support bolt of the electro de) or over the scalp, \nall of the light reaching the detectors propagates through the WM. Therefore, it is important to understand the \ndependence of the number of photons reaching the detector on the scattering properties of WM, which are not well \naccepted  in the literature so far  [2]. \nMethods: We’ve tested the effect of the effective attenuation coefficient of WM on the intensity of the light reaching \na detector   ( with a diameter of 600 μm, positioned inside the skull ) from a source implanted 1-6cm below it . The \nreduced scattering coefficient of WM was determined based on the literature to vary between 0.85mm-1 and 6mm-1, \nat wavelengths between 670 -830nm. We conducted a Monte -Carlo (MC) simulation, with 5 layers corresponding to \nScalp, Skull, Cerebro -spinal -fluid (CSF), Grey matter (GM) and WM. The simulations were conducted using the \nMCX toolbox for Matlab [3]. The optic al properties of the layers were taken from [4], while the reduced scattering \ncoefficient was varied between the above values.  In the simulations \n5*107 photons were launched, and the  detection limit was set to 100 \nphotons.  \nResults: The dependence of the logarithmic number of photons \nreaching a detector  on the distance between the implanted emitter and \nthe detector is shown in Fig 1, for different effective attenuation \ncoefficients ( μeff).  As can be seen, the curves decay exponentially . This \ncorresponds to the diffusi on model of infinite turbid med ium. In \naddition, light from a source -detector distance of up to 7cm could be \ndetected at the lowest scattering coefficient.   \nConclusion:  Scattering by the WM significantly affects the attenuation \nof light reaching a detector from an implanted source. MC simulations demonstrate an increase of  the reduced \nscattering coefficient from 0.85 to 6mm-1  reduces the measurable distance from 7 to 4cm. In order to measure the \noptical properties in -vivo, the distance of the implanted source from the detector should be varied, and the attenuation \nshould be determined based on an infinite -medium diffusion mod el.  \n \nAcknowledgements: \nThis research  was \nfunded by the Israeli \nInnovation Authority .

However, they are bulky and not easily transportable. We have developed \na miniaturised bNIRS system using HAMAMATSU’s SMD -type spectrometer and doped NIR -\nphosphor high -power LEDs . This new system, named microCYRIL, is wearable and fiberless, \nable to resolve  HbO2, HHb concentrations, and CCO with enhanced accuracy and  using a  multi -\ndistance configuration  to determine absolute values of tissue oxygen saturation.  \n \nIntroduction: Broadband NIRS (bNIRS) is an extension of fNIRS that provides the same assessment of  \noxygenation biomarkers  along with a valuable marker for oxygen metabolism at a cellular level, the oxidation \nstate of cytochrome -c-oxidase ( oxCCO). bNIRS implements many  (100s)  NIR wavelengths in the full NIR \nspectrum to address this and provide insight to tissue energetics. To supply these many wavelengths of light, \nbroadband sources are required,  and spectrometers are employed to distinguish  power per wavelength . Current \nmulti -channel bNIRS instruments are bulky and only semi -portable  due to the technological limitations. We \npropose a design for a bNIRS device that has been miniaturised to a llow for portable use . This design leverages \nthe innovations in photonic devices that have created a new line of micro -spectrometers and broadband NIR high \npower LEDs . This first-of-its-kind device , referred to as microCYRIL (after its two predecessors CYRIL and \nminiCYRIL) , has been developed for oxygenation and metabolism measurements with dual channel operation.  \nTo verify functionality,  concentration changes in oxygenated (HbO 2) and deoxygenated (H Hb) haemoglobin and \noxCCO were tracked during a cuff-induced venous and arterial occlusion.  \nMethods:  The novel bNIRS device has two channels , created by alternating power to two  individual  sources at 3  \nand 6 cm separations from the detector location.  The light source s are high-power  broadband LED s (Ushio, \nSMBBIR45 A) providing high intensity light in the visible -NIR region ( 700-1000nm) , which direct  light into the \nskin via a silicone  lens. The detector is a SMD  CMOS  spectrometer (Hamamatsu C14 384), coupled to patient skin \nvia a 90Û prism . Additional sensors  included in the design  are temperature monitoring  LM35 sensor and 6-axis \nmovement  sensor  MPU6050.  The sen sor module is connected to the control box  where the LED power and timing \nis regulated along with the single board computer that handles spectrometer \nacquisitions. Here a single push button and RGB LED is available for interface,  \nand a removable SD card for data storage. The device is labelled in figure 1 . \nThe spectrometer  was set to integration time of 1000 ms and the sensing module \nwas placed on the participant’s  bare forearm.  Data was collected in periods; (A) \nbaseline, (B) venous occlusion, (C) baseline, (D) arterial occlusion, (E)  baseline \nas seen in figure 2.1 . Each period lasted 60 seconds for a total acquisition of 5 \nminutes . Using the modified Beer -Lambert law-based  algorithm : UCLn, \nconcentration changes in HbO 2, HHb and oxCCO are calculated using the 3cm \nSDS and DPF of 4.16 . \nResults: Figure 2. 1 and 2.2  shows  expected \nresult s, with the overall spectral intensity being \nreduced during each vascular occlusion and \nrecovering in the rest periods, and a large \nchange in concentrations  of the chromophores \nmeasured in each occlusi on period. \nConclusion:   A novel dual-channel bNIRS \nsystem that is portable, fibreless,  and wearable \nhas been designed and conceived at UCL and  \ndemonstrates  promising results in the cuff \nocclusion test.  \nFigure 1: Image of microCYRIL \ndevice . \nFigure 2: (1) Spectra acquired at a single time point during each period . \n(2) Changes in concentration measured over the 5-minute  cuff occlusion  9 of 398",

Towards this, \nwe present th e TinyBrains device , a multimodal platform  for simultaneous  sensing  of (i) cerebral  blood  oxygenation \nthrough  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), (ii) cerebral blood flow through diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) \nand (iii) electrical activity through electroencephalography (EEG). Studying these three key parameters is important \nto develop a comprehensive  understanding of the link between metabolic demand and supply in the neonatal brain.  \nBringing two diffuse optics modalities together  in a dense array of integrated emitter and detector units enables high \ndensity hybrid diffuse optical tomography (HDhDOT)  of the superficial cortex of the neonate . \nSystem description: We have developed a  custom head -cap that support s up to 16 hybrid emitter units and 24 hybrid \ndetector units along with 8 EEG channel s on the periphery exclusive of reference and ground electrodes . Each hybrid \nemitter unit consists of dual -wavelength NIRS source operating at 660nm and 850 nm, and a DCS source operating at \n785 nm. The head -cap design  (Figure 1 ) is optimized  to provid e coverage with 20 channel s per wavelength per cm2 \nin the pre -frontal and temporal cortex  using optode separations of 14 mm and 23 mm. It can readily be adapt ed to \nsupport imaging over other regions . The head -cap can be reconfigured in a low-density  configuration for full head \ncoverage . Filters  are used to prevent inter -modality cross \ntalk between the two optical modalities  facilitating \nsimultaneous m easurements with NIRS and DCS . Spatial \nmultiplex ing of sources enable s acquisition rates of  2-4 Hz \nwith NIRS and 0 .5-1 Hz with DCS .  \nResults: In ex vivo measurements coefficients of variation \nof less than 0. 05% and 2% were obtained for the NIRS and \nthe DCS module resp ectively . The de vice demonstrates \nlinear performance for recovering changes in absorption \ncoefficients in both wavelengths in the range  0.1-0.5 cm-1. \nFaithful recovery of changes in oxygen saturation was \ndemonstrated with oxygen saturation mimicking \nphantoms. The intensity auto -correlation curves follow theoretical trends for estimated decorrelation times and signal -\nto-noise -ratio for all channels . \nConclusion:  We will present a detailed characterization of the device using ex -vivo phantom studies typifying \nstability, accuracy and robustness for HDhDOT measurements.

After several \nyears of design iterations and validation on more than 500 participants , ninjaCap  now provides \nreproducible positioning of fNIRS and EEG  with a novel spring -relaxation algorithm  yielding an \naverage  placement accuracy of 2.2±1.5  mm. A cloud -based pipeline for generation of printable \nninjaCap files is now available  on openfnirs.org . \nIntroduction:  Accurate and reproducible placement of sensing probes is crucial to reduce variance and increase \nstatistical power in studies that rely on non-invasive brain imaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS)  or diffuse optical tomography (DOT) . Traditional ly, textile caps from Electroencephalography  \n(EEG)  are used that require manual incorporation and placement of probe geometries and sensors .  This approach is \nnot only labor intensive but  can also fall short in providing the precision necessary for standardized and reproducible \nresearch. Our 3D printed ninjaCap s offer a solution that reduce s the time, cost, and variability  of probe placement .  \nMethods: ninjaCaps are generated with a user-defined probe geometry  and holders  on a 3D head  model using our \nAtlasViewer software. The model is cut and flattened with a novel spring -relaxation algorithm for translating 3D brain \ncoordinates onto 2D printable panels. This method preserve s geometrical fidelity that is crucial for accurate probe \npositioning. The panels are filled with a hexagonal lattice . 3D e xtrusion and assem bly of holders is done in Blender3D. \nPanels are 3D printed using flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials.  \nResults: Over the last years, t he design and manufacturing approach has been  iteratively refined through extensive \ntesting  and user feedback  with over 50 cap models and more than 500 participants . Using a 3D printed head model  \nfor ground truth , probe placement accuracy was determined as 2.2±1.5 mm  (avg±std). A cap print takes 5 -7hrs and 1 -\n2hrs of manual labor.  We have established a cloud -based pipeline for  automated ninjaCap generation, making this \ntechnology accessible to the broader research community  on bfnirs. openfnirs.org . \nConclusion:  We are continuing to improve our approach beyond the current generation. One focus of improvements \nis to further reduce probe placement errors in lateral/dorsal regions of the head. ninjaCap s provid e a scalable, cost -\neffective solution for precise and customizable probe placement  in neuroimaging using fNIRS, DOT, EEG , and other \nhead -worn sensors . Our goal is to  streamline the cap preparation process, enhancing the efficiency and consistency of \ndata collection both in group studies across diverse populations and in personalized brain imaging, to reduce variance \nand facilitate reproducibility in neuroscience research.   \nAcknowledgements:  The development of the ninjaCap has been funded in part under NIH U01EB0239856.

    "Cerebral blood flow response to functional stimuli assessed \nby interferometric  diffuse correlation spectroscopy     \n \nMitchell B. Robinsona, Bin Denga, Ailis Muldoona, Shakeeb Habasha, Maria Angela \nFranceschinia, Stefan A. Carpa \n \naAthinoula  A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, \nUnited States  \nmitchell.robinson@mgh.harvard.edu  \n \nAbstract:  To date, the majority of  non-invasive functional imaging has utilized signals based on \nhemoglobin contrast (fNIRS, fMRI). Previous work has documented that responses in \nmicrovascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) to functional stimuli are greater than functional responses \nin cerebral hemoglobin concentration, though portable and non -invasive instrumentation able to \nmeasure CBF wi th sufficient SNR and head coverage have been prohibitively expensive.  To address \nthis, we have developed a functional perfusion imaging system based on interferometric  diffuse \ncorrelation spectroscopy. In this work, we compare CBF and hemoglobin concentration responses \nto functional stimuli and demonstrate the feasibility of functional perfusion imaging.  \n \nIntroduction:  Most optical neuroimaging studies in humans have been based on measuring changes in hemoglobin \nconcentration (functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS))1, though functional changes in blood flow greatly \nexceed the changes in the hemoglobin concentration response2,3. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a \ncomparable NIR optical method that assesses blood flow in tissue, though traditional DCS has insufficient SNR at \noptode spacings where brain sensitivity is sufficient for adequate measurements4. Recent advances i n DCS technology \nhave enabled improved DCS instruments \ncapable of measuring with both high SNR \nand high cerebral sensitivity, enabling \nfunctional perfusion imaging.  \nMethods: A multichannel interferometric \nDCS (iDCS) system  (Figure 1)  adapted \nfrom a previously developed single channel \nsystem5 is compared to a commercial \nfNIRS (NIRX Scout) instrument in the \nassessment of hemodynamic responses to \nfunctional stimuli. Motor (finger tapping) \nand cognitive (mental subtraction) tasks are \nperformed. A common optode design \nallow s for back -to-back testing.  A GLM \nanalysis framework is then  used to derive \nfunctional responses to stimuli.  \nResults: fiDCS demonstrated localized blood flow changes in the motor cortex area during a contralateral (but not \nipsilateral) finger tapping task. Ongoing work is focusing on characterizing the response to cognitive stimuli and \ncomparing perfusion vs hemoglobin response s in conjunction with co -located sequential fNIRS measurements using \nan NIRx Scout imaging system.  \nConclusion:  The improved SNR of our 1064 nm  interferometric DCS instrument allow s for measurements at 3.1 cm \ninter-optode distance at a sampling rate of 5 Hz. The additional information provided by cerebral blood flow changes \nhas the potential to enable a more complete view of metabolic response for functional brain imaging.  \n \n1. Pinti, P. et al.

    "Towards a wearable,  fibre-free frequency -domain near -\ninfrared spectroscopy device using structured interrogation  \n \nNicholas A. Ross1, Ola Abdalsalam1, Scott Howard1, Hamid Dehghani2, Thomas D. O’Sullivan1,* \n \nDepartment of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame , Notre Dame, IN 46556, U.S.A.  \nSchool of Computer Science , University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT , U.K.  \n*tosullivan @nd.edu  \n \nAbstract:  We present a technique for wearable quantitative functional near -infrared spectroscopy \n(fNIRS ) based upon frequency -domain (FD)  NIRS using phased -array structured interrogation (SI). \nSI FD -NIRS has shown promise for improving quantitative multi -layer optical property estimation \nand depth sensitivity without increasing the source -detector density . In this simulation study we \nshow that adding SI to a simple two source/one detector multi -distance configuration can improve \noptical recovery from pediatric cortical tissue . Thus SI FD -NIRS represents a path toward higher \naccuracy wearable quantitative fNIR S using simpler source/detector layouts.   \n \nIntroduction:  Conventionally,  localization and accuracy of functional activation in functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy ( fNIRS ) can be improved with dense source/detector configurations . However, wearable fNIRS device \ndesigns pose practical requirements on probe complexity. We aim to improve fNIRS performance and enable \nquantitative wearable spectroscopy using  fewer sources and detectors  (Fig. 1 a). To accomplish this, we evaluate d a \nnovel  FD-NIRS method  known as  structured interrogation (SI) in a two source/one detector (2S/1D) array . We \nassess ed its suitability to quantify  optical properties (OP)  of multi -layered  tissue representing the extracerebral and \ncerebral  layers in an infant fNIRS model . Prior  research has shown that  the phase component of SI detected signals \nhas higher sensitivity to deeper tissue compared to conventional multi -distance (MD) arrays [ 1,2]. Here  we compare d \nSI and MD in recover ing OPs from a two -layered medium at depths of 5-10 mm using  2S/1D and 5S/1D , respectively .  \nMethods: We utilize d a modified version of NIRFAST  to simulate SI, which models multiple sources with defined \namplitude and phase relationships  [2]. The  simulated tissue model consisted of two -layers  (µa,top= 0.01 4 mm-1, µs,top'= \n0.84 mm-1, µa,bottom = 0.01 7 mm-1, µs,bottom '= 1.0 mm-1) derived from [3] to represent  the superficial and cortical layers \nof an infant  head . The 2S/1D  SI configuration had  individual  10 and 25 mm SDS  measurements combined with SI \nwith phase differences at 180 °, 198°, and 216° [1], and the 5S/1D  MD configuration had 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mm \nSDSs . The modulation frequency was 200 MHz . Normally distributed  noise was added to the real and imaginary  \ncomponents of the detected signal at 0.5% of the reflectance . For the inverse model , hard spatial priors are used to \nconstrain the OPs in each layer  and a nonlinear iterative solver was utilized  in MATLAB . This was repeated 100 times \nfor each top layer thickness . \nResults: Our results suggest  that incorporating SI into a MD array can improve OP recovery from cerebral layers in \nan infant model . The 2S/1 D SI array  show ed an improved  average OP error of 0.001 and 0.052 mm-1 for bottom layer \nµa and µ s’, respectively,  compared to 0.002 and 0.125 mm-1, for the 5S/1D MD  array  (Fig. 1b) . However, SI generally \nshowed slightly better variance for bottom layer µs’ and slightly worse for µa. \nConclusion:  This work highlights the potential of SI for improved multi -layer OP recovery  in fNIRS applications.  \nReferences:  \n[1] Abdalsalam, O. et al.

    "Quantifying neurovascular coupling through a concurrent assessment \nof arterial, capillary, and neuronal activation in humans: A \nmultimodal EEG -fNIRS-TCD investigation  \nJoel S. Burma,1 Ibukunoluwa K. Oni,1 Andrew P. Lapointe,2 Selina Rattana,1 Kathryn J. Schneider,1 Chantel T. Debert,1 \nJonathan D. Smirl,1 Jeff F. Dunn1 \n1University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2500 University Drive NW, T2N 1N4  \n2Atlas Institute for Veterans and Families, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada , 1145 Carling Ave., K1Z 7K4  \nJoel.burma@ucalgary.ca  \n \nAbstract: T he feasibility of an electroencephalography, functional near -infrared spectroscopy, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound  \nmultimodal imaging approach to assess neurovascular coupling during visual and motor tasks in healthy adults  was assessed . Task -\nspecific hemodynamic responses occurred in the brain, where neuronal activation was predictive of microvascular oxygenation c hanges \nduring both tasks. However, microvascular oxygenation was predictive of upstream arterial delivery during the visual ta sk only. Minimal \ninfluence from systemic physiological factors occurred , indicating the observed hemodynamic changes were primarily driven by \nneuronal activity. These findings suggest the proposed approach offers  potential insights for clinical applications in neurological and \ncerebrovascular conditions.  \n \nBackground : Neurovascular coupling (NVC) or functional hyperemia ensures the brain regions activated during tasks receive adequate \nblood flow. Previous studies commonly  used single -modality imaging to infer NVC from hemodynamic responses ; however, multimodal \napproaches allow for a direct, simultaneous assessment of neuronal and vascular responses.  This study explored a novel multimodal \nneuroimaging approach to assess NVC in humans using electroencephalography (EEG), functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fN IRS), \ntranscranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) , and systemic physiological recordings .  \nMethods : Fifteen participants (nine females/six males) completed EEG -fNIRS -TCD imaging during motor (fingertapping) and visual \n(“Where’s Waldo?”) tasks, with concurrent monitoring of blood pressure, capnography, and heart rate. fNIRS assessed relative changes \nin microvascular oxygenation within the frontal, motor, parietal, and occipital cortices, while the middle and posterior cerebra l arteries \n(MCA/PCA) were insonated using TCD. To quantify the similarity between block averages for the hemodynamic physiological \nresponses, cross -correlation analyses were conducted.  Finally, Granger Casualty analyses were completed between neurodynamic and \nhemodynamic waveforms during task activation broken into 5 -second increments  within the motor and occipital regions.  \nResults : The motor and occipital tasks elicited the largest area -under -the-curve and the absolute  delta  increase in oxygenated hemoglobin \nduring the fingertapping and Waldo tasks, respectively ( p<0.05 ). The EEG electrodes underlying the motor and occipital cortical regions \nwere predictive of the fNIRS changes via Granger Causality analysis ( p<0.05 ). However, microvasculature oxygenation was predictive \nof upstream arterial delivery during the visual task only (p<0.05 ). Cross -correlation analysis demonstrated  the change in oxygenated \nhemoglobin and cerebral blood velocity was moderate -to-strongly negatively correlated with systemic physiological influences  (i.e., \nbreathing, heart rate, and blood pressure , highlighting the measured hemodynamic change s were due to neuronal input  (r < -0.50) . \nConclusions : These findings  demonstrated the utility of the proposed EEG -fNIRS -TCD multimodal approach to capture the intricacies \nof the NVC response in humans during dynamic tasks.  This approach holds promise to  quantify the NVC in medical conditions as  many  \ndisorders have deficits to NVC (e.g., Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, brain injury).  \nFigure 1: Hemodynamic response of \noxygenated hemoglobin (HbO; red), \ndeoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR; blue), and \ntotal hemoglobin (THb; green) across the \nfour cortical regions of interest during the \nfingertapping and “ Where’s Waldo/Wally\" ” \ntasks.

    "Functional organization of syntactic cue processing in three-\nyear-old children correlates with language abilities \n \nLisa Bartha-Doering1, Ursula Pabst1,2, Sophie Mandl1, Julia Andrejevic1, Nadine Adrian1, \nLisa Emilia Ashmawy1, Patrick Appel1, Rainer Seidl1, Johanna Alexopoulos1,3 \n \n1Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria \n3Department of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Austria  \n \n  \nAbstract:  This study investigated hemodynamic changes in subject-initial versus object-initial \nsentences and their associations with syntactic language abilities in 3-year-old children. Children \nwith better syntactic abilities revealed increased left frontal and decreased right temporal activity \nduring sentence processing. We hypothesize that an earlier specialization of language areas towards \nthe left hemisphere is accompanied by an earlier syntactic development. \n \nIntroduction : Successful sentence comprehension of noun phrases requires knowledge of the relations between the \nverb and its arguments in order to understand who (agent) is doing what to whom (patient). In German, these simple \ntransitive structures can be expressed by a subject-initial (SVO) or object-initial (OVS) construction without changing \nits meaning. While topicalized subjects are much more common, German speakers have additional cues available to \ndecode this relationship (case-markers, semantic plausibility). Previous studies in typically developing children have \nshown that 3-year-olds use a subject-first word-order strategy and tend to decode noun-phrases correctly only when \nword order, case-markers, and semantic plausibility co-occur (Schipke et al., 2012). The present study explored if the \nfunctional organization of syntactic cue processing correlates with syntactic language abilities. \n \nMethods: Thirty-five healthy, monolingual, pre- and full term born 3-year-old children without any hearing or \nneurological problems were included in this study. We performed a standardized language assessment tapping \nsentence comprehension, sentence production, use of morphological rules, and phonological short-term memory. All \nchildren were able to comprehend noun phrases with congruent syntactic cues. Using a Hitachi ETG-4000 optical \ntopography system with 24 channels, we furthermore measured hemodynamic changes in response to SVO versus \nOVS sentences including transitive verbs and case-marked noun phrases with animate and inanimate objects. After \nexclusion of 12 children due to motion-related artifacts, data of 21 children were included in the final analysis (11 \ngirls, 12 preterms, gestational age at birth 24 – 42 weeks). \n \nResults: Preterm and full term born children did not significantly differ in their language abilities or their \nhemodynamic responses to the different syntactic conditions. However, repeated measures ANOVA in the overall \ngroup revealed a significant within-subject effect on HbO concentration changes for the factor word order (F (1,20) = \n10.24, p = 0.004, η2p = 0.339). In contrast, neither the factor hemisphere nor the factor animacy of objects had a \nsignificant effect on HbO concentration changes, and no significant interaction could be observed. Post-hoc analyses \nrevealed that OVS significantly increased hemodynamic changes in both hemispheres compared to SVO (t = 3.21, p \n= 0.004). Moreover, increased activity in left inferior frontal brain regions during OVS processing significantly \ncorrelated with better sentence comprehension (r = 0.58, p = 0.006), while decreased activity within right temporal \nbrain regions during OVS processing was associated with better sentence comprehension (r = -0.57, p = 0.007), \nsentence production ( r = -0.54, p = 0.014), and use of morphological rules (r = -0.58, p = 0.006).  \n \n Conclusion:  These results suggest that 3-year-old children are able to neurally differentiate between SVO and the \nmore challenging OVS sentences. Pre- and full term born children did not significantly differ in their language \ndevelopment nor hemodynamic responses. However, 3-year-olds with enhanced syntactic development showed \nincreased left frontal and decreased right temporal activity during OVS processing. We hypothesize that an earlier \nspecialization of language areas towards the left hemisphere is accompanied by an earlier syntactic development. \n \nReferences \n1. Schipke, C. S. et al.

Department of Psychology, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA  \n2. Behavioral Sciences  Department, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel  \nstotlerj2016@fau.edu  \n \nAbstract:  fNIRS hyperscanning was employed to examine the inter -brain synchronization \n(IBS) between infant -mother dyads during two types of tasks: 1) a free -play task, and 2) \nan instructed synchronization task. We used the LeaderFollowerByPhase  toolbox to \nclassify the types of neural coherence obtained as one of two phase -lags: in -phase \nsynchronization and anti -phase synchronization. We then examined differences in the \npercentage of  observed in- and anti-phase  synchronization between \nthe two task types. Our findings indicated a significant difference in \nanti-phase synchronizatio n across task , with more anti -phase \nsynchronization occurring during free -play, suggesting that different \npatterns of IBS may play a role in interpersonal coordination. \nIntroduction:  fNIRS hyperscanning methods allow for the simultaneous observation of \ncortical activity in two  or more  interacting persons. Often, the interpretation of hyperscanning \nwork is reduced to one dimension: is synchrony occurring or not? Common analytic methods \nsuch as wavelet transform coherence (WTC) can calculate level s of coherence , a measure of \ninter-brain synchrony (IBS),  between two brain signals. It could be argued that traditional \nanalysis methods disregard the directionality of occurring IBS (Hamilton, 2021) . Using the \nLeaderFollowerByPhase toolbox (Gvirts Provolovski et al., 2023), we examined the relative \namount (%) of observed  inter-brain  coherence classified into one of  two phase  lags: in-phase synchronization , where \ntwo brain signals are displaying near-identical patterns of activation  at the same timepoint , and anti-phase \nsynchronization , where two brain signals  are exhibiting inverse  activation  (Figure 1). Methods: Infant -mother dyads  \n(N=12, infants aged 7 – 23-months)  were fitted with fNIRS caps set with identical probe geometries ( Figure 2). For \nthe free -play task, mothers were provided a set of toys and asked to “play with your infant just as you normally would”. \nFor the instructed synchronization task, mothers  were provided with toys and  \ninstructed to “synchronize your behaviors with your infant’s behaviors”. NIRS \nand video were recorded  for 4 minutes in each task . Results: Data from channel \n18 w ere inspected for heartbeat and motion artifacts; any data lacking visible \nheartbeat was excluded. Data were  processed and motion artifacts corrected via \nHomer3 and converted to optical density. WTC  and cross -wavelet transform \n(XWT)  analys es were executed using the LeaderFollowerByPhase toolbox for \neach dya d for each tas k type separately  at channel 18 . The time -percentage for \nin-phase synchronization  and anti -phase synchronization w as obtained for each \ndyad for each task type , respectively . Findings indicated a significant difference \nin the amount of  anti-phase synchronization between task types; more anti -phase \nIBS occurred during free play  than during instructed synchronization  (Figure \n3). Conclusion:  Our preliminary findings suggest that different forms of IBS present differently in different types of  \ninterpersonal  contexts . In-phase synchronization and anti -phase synchronization represent different forms of \nsynchronization, yet they are commonly combined into a single representation of inter -brain coherence. Future work \nshould examine the relationship between various IBS pha ses and  their respective  relationships to  observable behaviors \nby mother and infant  in a variety of social interactions .  \nFigure 1.

    "Bidirectional information flow for cooperative learning with \nspontaneous leadership \nYuanyuan Li1, Ya-jie Wang1, Chang Su1, Fang Deng1, Yafeng Pan1,2* \n1 Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China  \n2 The State Key Lab of Brain -Machine Intelligence, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China  \n12439006@zju.edu.cn, yafeng.pan@zju.edu.cn  \nAbstract: This study examined  the hypothesis that cooperative learning involving  spontaneous \nleadership  relies on  bidirectional communication. Leveraging fNIRS hyperscanning and Granger \ncausality analysis  (GCA) , we investigated  the directionality and dynamics of  neural information \nflow. Throughout a 6-minute cooperative learning task, we observed a stronger leader -to-follower \nGC in the left medial temporal gyrus , alongside a more pronounced follower -to-leader GC in the \nleft sensorimotor cortex. Moreover, we found  that information transfer in both directions increased \nand peaked around  3-4 minutes into the task, with the follower -to-leader flow  showing a quicker \nrise. These findings  underscore a hierarchical organization of bidirectional communication  during \ncooperative learning . \nIntroduction:  Much of human learning  arises from cooperation with conspecific s. Previous hyperscanning studies \nhave shown that such cooperative learning is characterized by synchronization  between learners’ brains . However, the \ndirectionality of this synchronization and the role of spontaneous leadership (i.e., a group leader emerges naturally) in \ncooperative learning remain unclear.  There is ongoing d ebate regarding  whether cooperative learning with \nspontaneous leadership  follows a unidirectional  pattern , where information flows dominantly  from leaders to followers  \n(the social dominance hypothesis ), or it is bidirectional  (the social interdependence hypothesis ). By using Granger \ncausality analysis (GCA), a method capable of estimating directional connections between two time series,  we \nanalyzed fNIRS hyperscanning data collected during  real-time cooperative learning. This approach has proven \neffective in parsing information flow both within and between  individuals . Our aim is to demonstrate  how each group \nmember's brain activity predicts that of others, with the goal of informing future strategies for optimized group learning.  \nMethods: Ninety  college students were randomly paired into  same -sex dyads , with no prior acquaintance , to \nparticipate in a 6-minute cooperative learning task  (i.e., collaboratively analyzing an ancient Chinese poem ). During \nthe task, the ir brain  activity was recorded simultaneously using fNIRS , while the whole process  was recorded by \ndigital  video s. We did not pre-assign  a leader within each dyad.  After the experiment, two assistants independently \nviewed the video recordings to identif y the leader within each dyad . Subsequently, t wo additional coders, who were \nblind to the leader selection,  annotated the verbal communication in the recordings . For each dyad member, the coders \nassessed the ' quality ' of communication, i.e., the correctness of responses , as well as the 'quantity ', i.e., the duration of \ncontribution to the discussion . Behaviorally, we analyzed  these communicative signals and explored how they \nunfolded over time. At the neural level, w e estimated the information flow between the (spontaneous) leader and the \nfollower based on the pairwise  GC between fNIRS time series within each dyad.  \nResults: Throughout the 6 -minute cooperative learning task, leaders consistently demonstrated higher levels of \ncommunication quality and quantity than followers. The overall  quality of communication ( combining leader and \nfollower scores) peak ed at 3-4 minutes into the task , while the overall quantity remained relatively constant. GCA of \nthe fNIRS  data revealed a stronger  leader -to-follower GC in the medial temporal gyrus , along with  a stronger follower -\nto-leader GC in the se nsorimotor cortex.  Mirroring our behavioral patterns regarding communication quality, we \nobserved that  mean GC also reached its peak  during the 3 -4-minute interval . GC in both directions showed an increase \nbefore the 4th minute of the task, with the flow from followers to leaders increasing more rapidly, followed by a \ndecrease. Finally, our correlation analysis indicated that the leader -to-follower GC was associated with the quality of \nleaders' communication, while the follower -to-leader GC correlated with the followers' perceptions  of peer support.  \nConclusion:  Our findings suggest  that information flow in cooperative learning  with spontaneous leadership is \nbidirectional . Consistent  with prior research, leaders typically initiate interactions , as indicated by their significantly \ngreater communication quality and quantity. This proactive role underscores the leader's function in initiating \ndiscussions and steering group dynamics,  as reinforced  by the positive correlation between leader s' communication \nquality and the GC from leaders to followers . In turn,  followers also wield considerable influence . The stronger GC \nfrom followers to leaders indicates their active engagement, which, associated  with their perceptions of support, \ncompletes the feedback loop of influence.  These two directions depend on distinct  temporal and spatial mechanisms, \ndemonstrating  a hierarchical structure  of bidirectional communication in cooperative learning.  17 of 398",
    "Combining TMS  and fNIRS to explore the cortical \ncorrelates of the interhemispheric inhibition  \n \nCostanza Iester1, Alice Bellosta1, Monica Biggio1, Elena Monteleone1, Ludovico Pedullà2, Ambra Bisio3, \nSabrina Brigadoi4, Simone Cutini4, Laura Bonzano1,5, Marco Bove3,5 \n \n1 Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa,  Italy \n2 Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Scientific Research Area, Genoa, Italy  \n3 Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Human Physiology, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy  \n4 Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy  \n5 IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy,  \nPresenting Author email address: marco.bove@unige.it  \n \nAbstract:  The aim of this work was to evaluate the cortical correlates of the ipsilateral silent period \n(iSP). Left primary motor cortex  (M1)  was stimulated by transcr anial magnetic s timulation (TMS)  \nand iSP was assessed on the left first dorsal in terosseous (FDI) muscle . Concomitantly f unctional \nNear InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS) recorded cortical hemodynamic activity  of the right \nhemisphere . Fronto -parietal hemodynamic activity during FDI isometric contraction changed when  \niSP occurred . Furthermore, iSP area positively correlated with  HbO concentration changes in right \nM1 suggesting  that detected hemodynamic activity might  reflect the activity of neuronal population \nlocated in different cortical layers (i.e., pyrami dal and inter-inhibitory neurons).  \n \nIntroduction:  iSP is used to investigate the interhemispheric control of voluntary cortical motor output1. It consists \nof a brief interruptio n of voluntary electromyography  in a hand muscle  during an isometric contraction  through focal \nTMS  of the ipsilateral M1. Despite being a frequently measured index of interhemispheric inhibition, the neural \ndynamics underlying the iSP effect remain unknown. Aim of this work was  to simultaneously investigate the iSP and \nthe associated cortical  dynamics by combining TMS and fNIRS2. \n \nMethods: Fifteen healthy young adults were recruited (26±6.1  years , 11 females). To investigate the left iSP and its \ncortical  correlates, TMS was positioned on the left hemisphere  and surface EMG activity was recorded from left FDI \nmuscle , while fNIRS optodes were arranged on the right hemisphere  obtain ing 49 standard channels (3cm) and 8 \nshort -separation channels (8mm). TMS intensity stimulation was set to the 120% of the resting motor threshold for \neach subjec t3. The experiment consisted of two different conditions in which participant s were  instructed to maximally \ncontract the left hand  with or without  TMS stimulation . For each condi tion, 25 trials were collected (task +rest  duration: \n~1+20s). fNIRS channels with low signal -to-noise ratio were discarded; intensity data were converted to attenuation \nchanges and motion artifacts were corrected by applying spline  and wavelet  motion correction techniques4; a band -\npass filter (0.01 -3Hz) was applied, and the mean hemodynamic response for each task block, and channel was \nrecovered using a general lin ear model approach.  \n \nResults: In both conditions, HbO  concentration increased  in sensorimotor and associative  parietal areas. However, i n \nTMS condition, when iSP occurred , HbO concentration  decreased  in several cortical areas.  Despite this reduction , we \nfound a positive correlation between HbO concentration changes in right M1 and iSP area, i.e. , the higher the activity \nin right M1 , the higher the iSP  area corresponding to  stronger  interhemispheric inhibition.  \n \nConclusion:  In this work , for the first time, we explored  the cortical  correlates of the  iSP. We showed that the \nhemodynamics of areas active during maximal isometric are modulated when  iSP occurs.  Furthermore, the \ncorrelation between the iSP area and HbO concentration changes in right M1  suggests that fNIRS -detected activity  \nmight  reflect the activity of different populations of neurons : inhibitory inter neurons  and pyramidal neurons  located \nin differen t cortical layers . We can conclude that t hese finding can shed further light in understanding the cortical \nnature  of the ipsilateral silent  period . \n \n1. Hupfeld, K. E. et al.  (2020).

    "Mapping Cortical Activations Underlying Speech Processing \nAcross Development via Simultaneous fMRI-fNIRS \n \nS. Sanchez -Alonsoa, R.R. Canaleb, I. Nichosonc, V. Chambersa, and R.N. Aslina,b,d  \n \naChild Study Center,  New Haven, CT, USA, bDepartment  of Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, Department of Psychology, \nTulane University, LA, USA,  dDepartment of Psychology, Y ale University, New Haven, CT  USA \nPresenting Author email address: sara.sanchez.alonso@yale.edu  \nAbstract:  Speech processing in the adult brain has been associated with a  set of left -lateralized \nfronto -temporal language regions. Importantly, the developmental changes that lead to this mature  \nlanguage system  remain understudied. We report fMRI -fNIRS signals from  a language localizer \ntask in 40 young adults using our previously -validated simultaneous  data collection protocol \n(Sanchez -Alonso et . al., 2023). In turn, we are collecting data  from children aged 5 -to-7 years old \nusing the same simultaneous fMRI -fNIRS approach and a naturalistic language localizer task.  \nCollectively, these data aim to validate fNIRS as a readily accessible and cost -effective tool for \nfuture developmental studies of the language system.  \nIntroduction:  A fronto -temporal language system  engaged in speech processing and language comprehension has \nlong been characterized in the adult brain. It is unclear, however, how these  language regions develop and what type \nof structural and functional developmental changes lead to the mature  language system . Partly, this is due to the \nchallenges of conducting longitudinal functional mag netic resonance  imaging ( fMRI ) studies with pediatric samples. \nA more versatile tool to study brain function in young children is functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) due \nto its portability, ease of implementation in naturalistic settings and robustness to motion relative to fMRI. However, \nit is unclear to what extent  classical language  areas can be capture d with fNIRS . Therefore , studies assessing the \ncorrespondence between fMRI and fNIRS modalities using traditional language  localizers are needed to validate \nfNIRS as an accessible tool for developmental studies of the language system. To address this gap , we report two \nstudies  that assess  the correspondence  across simultaneously -collected fMRI and fNIRS signals using language \nlocalizer paradigms .  The overall goal is to  assess  the feasibility of implementing fNIRS  to probe the language system \nin infants  and young children.  \nMethods: Study 1  (data collection complete) : We collected simultaneous fMRI (Siemens 3T PRISMA) and fNIRS \n(NIRx NIRScout -XP) signals in 40 young adults (18 - to 35 -year-olds) us ing a  previously -validated language  localizer \ntask (Binder et al., 2011 ). Study 2  (ongoing ): Simultaneous fMRI -fNIRS signals are currently being collected from a \ngroup of young children (5- to 7-year-olds) (target n= 25) using a naturalistic language localizer task . This naturalistic \nparadigm consists of 20 -sec child -friendly clips that contrast speech vs nonspeech (i.e., time -reversed speech) \nconditions.   Data preprocessing:  The fNIRS data are preprocessed  using  NeuroDOT  (Eggebrecth & Culver, 2019 ) to \ncreate anatomically registered maps of cerebral hemodynamic s. Image reconstruction steps include mapping optode \nlocations to  the individual anatomical images, implementing  the light model , and running 3D image reconstruction on \nCIFTI surface maps. In addition, we use d eight short -separation fNIRS channels to measure and remove extracerebral \nsignals. The fMRI data are preprocessed via Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipelines (Glasser et al., 2013) , which \ninclude the latest denoising approaches and surface mapping methods. For scalp -to-anatomy co -registration of the \nfNIRS signal, we use  a direct mapping of optode locations to the T1w image via vitamin E capsules  on the fNIRS \ncaps at each optode location . A key innovation is co -registration of fNIRS channels to the individual’s cortical surface \n(i.e., a CIFTI surface map), and co -registration of fMRI voxels using the HCP MMP 1.0 atlas (Glasser et al., 2016)  \nand subsequent cortical parcellation, which consists of 180 cortical areas per hemisphere.  \nResults: Results from the adult sample ( Study 1 ) show that , similar to fMRI, fNIRS signal s recruit  canonical  language \nregions in fronto -temporal cortices  with lateralization to the left hemisphere . We show that decreases  in deoxygenated \nhemoglobin in image reconstructed fNIRS signals coincide with BOLD -positive regions in language  cortex areas . \nOngoing quantitative analyses of the two signals consist of assessing the timeseries  temporal correlation across fMRI \nand fNIRS  as a function of cortical region, location of the fNIRS probe s, and implementation of different smoothing \nparameters during fMRI data preprocessing . Data collection of the developmental sample ( Study 2 ) is ongoing  and \nwill be preprocessed following the same workflow as described for the adult sample  in Study 1 .  \nConclusion : Our study  provide s a comparison of fMRI and fNIRS signals collected simultaneously from the same \nsubjects  and shows that fNIRS can be used to investigate  cortical activations underlying speech processing during a \ntraditional language localizer task . Ongoing data collection with a developmental sample will shed light on the \nfeasibility of implementing fNIRS and naturalistic imaging paradigms to study the language system in young children.   19 of 398",
    "Improving contrast and spatial resolution of tomographic  \nfNIRS with activation -prior-guided reconstruction  \nAshlyn McCann1, Edward Xu1, and Qianqian Fang1 \n1Department of Bioengineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA  \npresenter email: mccann.as@northeastern.edu  \nAbstract:  Tomographic fNIRS reconstructions often result in low -resolution brain activation maps, \nmaking it especially challenging to accurately pinpoint brain activations within complex cortical \nfolding structures. Here, we present an improved DOT -fNIRS reconstruction approach to ac hieve \nhigher activation contrast and spatial localization accuracy by testing a hypothesized activation -\nprior across various cortical regions. Sample reconstructions are reported for both simulated and \nmeasured fNIRS data, showi ng a 3 -fold improvement in image contrast and a 2 -fold reduction in \nestimated activation size.  \nIntroduction: Limited spatial resolution in tomographic fNIRS makes it difficult to localize brain activity, which is \ncrucial for understanding the underlying neural circuitry. We have previously developed a target -enhancing DOT \nreconstruction technique and validated it  for localizing high -contrast small -sized breast tumors. This method allows \nusers to impose an expected target shape in the form of regularization and iteratively test such “target -template” across \nthe full imaging volume; when the tested template collocat es with a true tumor, the recovered image contrast can be \ngreatly enhanced; otherwise, only marginal change is found [1]. We hypothesize that this target -enhancement \ntechnique can also be applied to tomographic fNIRS to recover brain activations with high spatial accuracy.  \nMethods: Both simulation and human data are used to validate this approach in tomographic fNIRS. All simulations \nand reconstructions are performed using our in -house diffusion solver using 5 iterations. A 5 -layer full -head mesh \nmodel is generated from the MNI152 he ad atlas; a brain activation is simulated in the cortical surface as a localized \nabsorption coefficient perturbation (Δȝ a). A Gaussian -sphere -shaped target prior is used. Using a probe design shown \nin Fig. 1a, with a source wavelength of 850 nm, w e test two prior -guided reconstructions, one placing the prior over \nthe true activation location (concordant) and the other not in alignment (discordant). We further test the algorithm \nusing the in-vivo measurements provided by the NeuroDOT tutorial [2]. The clinical data is pre -processed following \nthe NeuroDOT tutorial. Briefly, the raw data is first block averaged to obtain the hemodynamic response function, \nfrom which the ratios of the optical density  (OD) at the peak change (16 seconds after the onset) of each channel and \nthat of the baseline are used to obtain the calibrated measurements used for the reconstruction.  \nFig. 1. Reconstructed absorption coefficients (1/mm) using in-vivo data with a cortically constrained reconstruction: a) with no \nactivation prior, and those using b) discordant and c) concordant activation priors, compared with a volumetric reconstructio n \nfrom NeuroDOT.  \nResults: The simulated ground -truth activation is located on the left occipital lobe, having a Gaussian profile with a \nfull-width half -max (FWHM) of 4.0 mm and a maximum Δȝ a=0.009/mm. With a concordant prior, the recovered \nmaximum Δȝ a is 0.009/mm with an FWHM of 4.0 mm. In comparison, reconstructions using a discordant prior yielded \na maximum Δȝ a=0.004/mm with a FWHM of 8.0 mm, which is nearly identical to those recovered without using \npriors. Using concordant prior on the human data (Fig. 1c) yields a maxi mum Δȝ a of 0.043/mm and FWHM of 7.6 \nmm, compared to Δȝ a=0.015/mm and FWHM=13.6 mm in the discordant case. We note here that NeuroDOT’s \nvolumetric reconstruction (Fig. 1d) reports a FWHM of 10.5 mm.  \nConclusion:  The use of activation -prior enhances the recovered optical contrast by roughly 3x, and reduces the \nactivation FWHM by roughly 2x in both of our tests using simulated data and in-vivo measurements.  \nReferences:  [1] Fang Q, “Method to localize small and high contrast inclusions in ill -posed model -based imaging modalities,” \nUS Patent US11246529B2. 2022 Feb 15          [2]Eggebrecht et al. “NeuroDOT: An extensible Matlab toolbox for streamlined \noptical functional ma pping,” presented at the European Conference on Biomedical Optics, Optica Publishing Group, Jun. 2019, p. \n11074_26. https://github.com/WUSTL -ORL/NeuroDOT  \n20 of 398",

Significant \nvariability in findings was observed, underscoring the importance of transparency in data analysis \nand the need for converging on best practices in analysis methodologies  to enhance replicability and \nreliability  of fNIRS research.  \nBackground : Concerns over r eplicability in science have led to examination of the factors influencing research \noutcomes, particularly  in neuroimaging  [1]. Here, we designed a collaborative multi -lab study to investigate  variability \nin functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) hypothesis testing outcomes  and explore the effect of  analysis \nchoices on fNIRS findings.  \nMethods: 102 researchers worldwide , work ing in 38 groups , were provided with two published fNIRS datasets \nalongside a series of hypotheses to test, both at the group and individual levels. The first dataset , from an auditory \nexperiment involving speech and noise stimuli, targeted  group -level analysis. The second dataset , from a motor task, \nfocus ed on individual -level analysis. Researchers were tasked to analy ze these datasets without any specific guidance \non methodologies.  Following the initial analysis stage , all groups  submitted their findings through a structured form, \nwhich included their conclusions on the hypotheses tested and detailed descriptions of the analytical pipelines used. \nA follow -up questionna ire further solicited information on the researchers ' self-assessed confidence in their analysis \nskills and the reliability of their results, alongside specific details about the software and toolboxes utilized.  The data \nprovided by the groups were analyzed by a  separate  group  of researchers who had not submitted any reports.   \nResults: The results revealed  a significant degree of variability in hypothesis testing outcomes , which can be attributed \nto different analy sis pipelines. In the group -level analysis of the auditory dataset, the majority of the participating \ngroups agreed  on the outcomes of six out of seven hypotheses. Conversely, the individual -level analysis of the motor \ntask dataset demonstrated a lower level of consensus. Correlation analysis between participants' self -reported \nconfidence and their hypothesis testing  outcomes suggested that higher confidence, potentially stemming from more \nextensive experience, was associated with greater consistency in result s. A detailed examination of the analysis  \npipelines showed  a great variety of analytical preferences in data  processing . A logistic regression analysis revealed \nthat t he analysis steps Pruning, HRF Model, HRF Estimation Method, Signal Space for Statistical Testing and Multiple \nComparison’s Correction, are all found to be statistically significant predictors of the hypothesis testing outcomes.   \nConclusion:  These findings  demonstrate  how analytical flexibility strongly influences hypothesis testing in fNIRS, \ncreating notable variability in outcomes, highlighting  the need for adhering to  best practices in fNIRS analysis to \nreduce variability and improve  the reliability and credibility of research  findings with fNIRS . \n[1] Botvinik -Nezer, R. et al.

    "Data-driven optimization of the Hemodynamic Response \nFunction for fNIRS data analysis  \nLetizia Contini1*, Rebecca Re1,2 and Paola Pinti3,4  \n \n1 Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Fisica, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan  \n2Istituto  di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan  \n3 Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London, London WC1E  7JL \n4 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT3  \nletizia.contini@polimi.it  \n \nAbstract:  In this study, we present a method for extracting the hemodynamic response function \n(HRF) from fNIRS data by optimizing the two -gamma model parameters in the GLM framework. \nThe method was validated both on simulated data and data acquired using block - and event -related \nGo/NoGo tasks collected on adults and toddlers. When comparing the results of the optimized HRF \nwith the canonical HRF, little difference was found in the activation maps, suggesting that the use \nof the canonical HRF does not introduce significant errors even  in cases where the real response has \na different shape and timing.  \n \nIntroduction:  The G eneral Linear Model (GLM)  is a popular analysis method for fNIRS data  analysis which typically \nrequire s the a -priori assumption of the shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, the HRF is \nunknown for certain populations (e.g. infants) and might differ in atypical or unhealthy cohorts, making the GLM not \nfully applicable. To overcome this issue, we propose a method to estimate the HRF directly from fNIRS data . This \nallows accounting for individual variability, possibly lea ding to more  reliable interpretations of neural activity, which \nis of particular interest in neurodevelopmental studies, where high variability at different developmental stages is \nexpected.  Moreover, this method enables to investigate how age, neurological conditions and other factors influence \nthe shape of the response. In this study , we propose a method for extracting the parameters of the most widely used \nmodel of HRF , i.e. the two -gamma function. We test this method on fNIRS data acquired during a Go/N oGo task. \nAdditionally, we address the effect of assumptions made on the HRF on the obtained activation maps.  \nMethods: fNIRS data from 23 channels (+1 short channel) were recorded over the prefrontal cortex in 19 healthy \nadults performing  two computer ized Go/NoGo  tasks, designed in a fast ER and block -design fashion . The block design  \nincluded  12 blocks comprising 6 Go and 6 mixed (Go/No -Go) trials  of 30s each, spaced by  jittered  rest periods 8-12s. \nFor the ER design, participants completed 6 runs  of 60s each. Three stimuli,  Go, NoGo and n ot-event s, were presented \nrandomly with an average intertrial interval  (ITI)  of 1s. fNIRS dat a were preprocessed and short channel regressed \nout. A series of GLM models with different combinations of the peak and undershoot of the HRF were run and \ncompared in terms of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to identify the best fit for both tasks. The undershoot \nratio was additionally tuned for the ER task. The method was first validated using simulated data and then on the real \nfNIRS data. Finally, a GLM approach was used to localize functional activation during the block design task by \nassuming 4 different HRFs: the default canonical one (HRFc), the best fit for the block (HRFb) and the ER ( HRFe 1, \nHRFe 2) designs . The method was further tested to fNIRS data recorded on toddlers2. \nResults: The good agreement among HRFb, HRFe 1 and HRFe 2 (Figure, left), especially in terms of peak position, \ndemonstrate the validity of the method used to optimize the HRF model parameters, and the almost perfect \nsuperimposition of HRFb and HRFe 1 suggests that this method enables to reliably reconstruct the real HRF from data \nacquired using block -designed experiments. Despite the deviation of the extracted HRFs from the canonical one, we \nfound little difference in terms of activation patterns with differ ent \nHRF models (Figure, right). Assuming HRFe 2 instead resulted in no \nactive channels. Similar results were obtained for the dataset \nacquired on toddlers, with the active locations remaining similar \nacross different models.  \nConclusion:  This study suggests that the HRFc  maybe a good \nmodel for adults and toddlers fNIRS data. Future work is needed to \ninvestigate if the use of HRFc introduces significant errors in other \ncohorts such as in infants or clinical populations.  \n \n1. Schroeter, M. L. et al.

    "A Hybrid Deep Learning and Model-Based Approach for \nfunctional Diffuse Optical Tomography of Adult Brain \n \nJiaming Cao1,* and Hamid Dehghani1 \n \n1School of Computer Science , University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, United Kingdom  \n*j.cao.2@bham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  The quality of DOT reconstruction can be severely deteriorated when noise is high and \nbaseline optical properties are inaccurately assumed. To improve DOT reconstruction accuracy, a \nhybrid approach  is proposed , where a neural network is used to enhance the results of the classic \nTikhonov regularization,  and its effectiveness  is demonstrated  using functional activation data . \n \nIntroduction:  Diffuse optical tomography (DOT)  has seen great success in both clinical and neuroscientific \napplications. It has been shown in previous work that when a high -density grid is used, the spatial accuracy of \nfunctional DOT (fDOT) reconstruction can be comparable to fMRI, making it a promising bedside -compatible \nsubstitute for  fMRI. However, it is still challenging to  ensure high spatial accuracy, due to the presence of \nmeasurement noise and inaccurate assumption s on tissue optical properties. In this work , a novel hybrid approach is \nproposed to address this issue: a reconstruction is first estimated using the classic model -based Tikhonov \nregularization, and then enhanced using a neural network. Using functional data on a realistic head model it is \ndemonstrated that the proposed method can effectively and reliably improve the reconstruct ion of  the brain activation \nlocations . \nMethods: The forward model was constructed using the NeuroDOT toolbox [1], with the standard brain model and \nthe template 24x28 grid on the visual cortex. Brain activations are assumed at 1 -3 locations simultaneously, each \nmodeled as a 1 cm -radius sphere with  a 10% increase of the baseline absorption coefficient  (µa). The locations were \nconstrained to the intersection between the brain gray matter and where the sensitivity of the grid is high.  2500 sets of \ndata were simulated, and in each simulation, the baseline µa of all the layers (scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, and white \nmatter) were randomly varied by ±10%.  Up to 1% of white noise was added  to the optical density changes ( DOD). \nClassic model -based reconstruction was performed using Tikhonov regularization [2] on the noisy DOD, with standard \noptical properties used.  All data was interpolated onto a uniform grid with 2 mm resolution. The results were \nsubsequently used to train a U -Net: the classic reconstruction was its input and the ground truth was its target.  2048 \nimages were used as the training set, 352 as the validation set, and 100 as the testing set.  Only the posterior section of \nthe head model was used  for training, and all images were normalized to their standard deviation . \nResults: An example result is shown in Fig. 1.  The results are interpolated onto a surface mesh for visualization.  µa \nof the different layers (same order as above) were varied for -7.3%, -8.9% , -3.2%, 6.1%, and -7.5% from the assumed \nvalues in reconstruction  with 6.4% noise added. The activation spots are  barely  visible using only Tikhonov \nregularization and the artifacts are substantial . The \nneural network successfully recovered all three spots \naccurately. Across all the 100 testing sets, the Dice \ncoefficient increased from 5.75±8.94% (poor in both \naccuracy and stability) to 52.8±12.1%.  \nConclusion:  A  hybrid approach chaining the classic \nTikhonov with a denoising neural network  is developed , \nand demonstrated in situ  on head models , showing  it can \nsubstantially increase the accuracy of DOT \nreconstruction in  the presence of measurement noise \nand inaccurately assumed optical properties. The \nmethod is to be further validated using experimental data and presented to highlight its effectiveness . \n \nReferences  \n1. Eggebrecht and Culver.

Spatial and temporal  concordance between modalities  and various data \nprocessing  pipelines  were assessed . The results confirm  high spatial and temporal correlation and \nhighlight the necessity of using  an ad-hoc pipeline for the cerebellar region of interest . \n \nIntroduction:  In prior  work1, we demonstrated the feasibility of high -density cerebellar fNIRS with concordant fMRI \nresults. However, sequential acquisitions and subject -specific  optimized  optode montages introduced potential intra -\nsubject variability. This study addresses this concern  by implementing simultaneous fNIRS/fMRI with a standardized \ngrid montage based on predefined fiducial landmarks.  \nMethods: Ten healthy subject s (1 left-handed ) underwent concurrent CW -fNIRS  and fMRI scans during an auditory -\ncued finger -to-thumb opposition task  (20 trials: 10s activity + 30 -38s rest). The fMRI w ere acquired using GRE -EPI \nsequences (3.7 mm3, TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, 41 slices)  and complemented with  20 fNIRS  channels on the  motor cortex \nand 14  on the cerebellum (SDD = 3 cm). Both modalities were analyzed using a single -subject GLM block -design \nframework with varying nuisance regressors.  Temporal correlation between  the upsampled  BOLD averages and the \nGLM -estimated HRF s was obtained  per subject and ROI.  Spatial correlation s between group -averaged fNIRS and \nfMRI β maps ( GLM -derived ) were compute d using tailored  pipelines inspired by various sources2-3, by changing the \nHRF model (ca nonical/FIR), solver (ordinary /AR-ILS LS) , or adding motion, physiology, or bi -directional regressors.  \nResults: After preprocessing , 7 subjects were fully retained.  fMRI activations are displayed in Fig. A.  Temporal \ncorrelation analysis (Fig . B) revealed higher variability within the cerebellum, with coefficients showing a bimodal \ndistribution (all >|0.5|).  To investigate BOLD -fNIRS coupling,  a remarkable compliance was achieved by  overlaying \nthe average BOLD signals from each ROI and subject wi th the corresponding fNIRS channel exhibiting the highest  \ntemporal  correlation  (Fig. C). T he spatial  correlation patterns  (Fig. D) exhibited high variability in terms of polarity . \nOne-way non-parametric ANOVA  revealed  significant pipeline differences (p < 0.001) within  fMRI data  and HbR \nresults . \nConclusion:  This study \ninvestigated concurrent  \ncerebellar  fNIRS /fMRI \nrecordings during a \nmotor task and found \nhigh spatial and temporal \ncorrelations between the \ntwo modalities , even with \ngeneric high -density \nmontage .

    "Statistical model transfer learning for fNIRS \nusing fMRI-trained CNN models. \n \nTheodore Huppert1, Xuetong Zhai1, Hendrick Santosa2 \n \n1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \n2Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \nhuppert1@pitt.edu  \n \nAbstract:  One of the challenges of the application of deep learning models to neuroimaging is the \nneed for extremely large (>10,000 participant) datasets for training models .  In the case of fNIRS, \nsince each instrument manufacturer and each research lab often use different probe montages and/or \ncollection methods, the availability of very large, homogenous fNIRS datasets is not practical.  In \nthis work, we show that we can us e model transfer learning to take a convolutional neural network \n(CNN), which has been pretrained on a very large fMRI dataset and transfer it to fNIRS using a much \nsmaller fNIRS -specific additional training data.     \nIntroduction:   Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of machine deep learning model that have been \ndeveloped and widely used over  the last decade for image classification in computer vision topics. These models \ntypically have dozens to hundreds of layers and millions of model parameters which must be estimated , which requires \nmassive training datasets .  One popular such model is the ResNet50 CNN [1], which uses 177 layers and contains 25  \nmillion parameters.  This model was developed by Microsoft in 2015 using the ImageNet open image database \nconsisting of currently 14 million labeled examples of over 1,000 different image types (e.g.  cat, dog, etc.).  While \ntraining these models fully from scratch requires massive amounts of training data and computational power, model \ntransfer learning methods can be used to transfer a pre -trained model to a different domain.  Model transfer is often  \ndone by freezing most of the deeper layers of a pre -trained model and then refitting only a few layers of the model \nusing a new dataset.  In this way, a model that was trained to recognize (e.g.) cats versus dogs, can be retrained to read \nMRI images and f ind tumors (e.g. see [2] for review).     \nMethods. We used a double model transfer learning approach.  First the \nResNet50 model was transferred to classify images of functional brain \nactivity from fMRI datasets.  Here, we used the open  access  data \navailable from the Human Connectome Project [3], which consisted of \na total of around 1,200 healthy subjects preforming a total of 7 different \nfunctional tasks (e.g. working memory, language, motor, theory of \nmind, etc.) with a total of 27 total functional conditions.  This fMRI data \nwas first converted into a two -dimensional image based on projection \ninto the international 10 -20 coordinate system.  The input and final two \nlayers of the pretrained ResNet50 model are then retrained based on this \nset of  24,600  fMRI images.  Once the ResNet50 model has been \ntransfers to classify brain imaging data using this fMRI sample, the \nmodel is transferred again from a fMRI problem to fNIRS data.  Using \nthe same E -Prime task paradigms (N -back, Theory of Mind, and \nMath/Language tasks only  for 6 total task conditions) used in the HCP, \n13 subjects were collected using fNIRS.  First level statistical maps were \nestimated and similarly converted into 10 -20 maps of brain activity.  A \n13-fold validation approach was used to retrain and test the model.         \n  \nResults.  At the fMRI data model (first transfer model), our CNN model \nis able to obtain 98%  classification accuracy on the full 27 -way model \n(random is 3.7%).  For the fNIRS model (second transfer model), 72% \nclassification was achieved on the 6 -way model (random is 16.7%) using our  experimental data.  \n \nReferences:  [1].

    "Disrupted functional connectivity and delayed \nresponses in severe carotid artery stenosis patients: \ninsights from fNIRS on vasoreactivity test \n \nV. Sanchez1*, C. Gonçalves2, A. Quiroga3, R. C. Mesquita1,4,5 \n \n1Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Institute of Physics, Campinas, Brazil ( *vsanchez@ifi.unicamp.br ) \n2Universidade Catolica de Pelotas, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Pelotas, Brazil  \n3ICFO – Institut de Ciències Fotòniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain  \n4BRAINN – Brazilian Institute of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology, Campinas, Brazil  \n5University of Birmingham, School of Computer Science, Birmingham, UK  \n \nAbstract:  In this study, we used fNIRS and graph theory to evaluate the \ncerebrovascular reserve of carotid artery stenosis  (CAS) patients during a vasoreactivity \ntest. Our findings showed variations in functional connectivity networks  that depend on \nCAS severity . Severe CAS patients were  able to recover a fully functional network after \na delay , suggesting a highly connected architecture in response to vasoreactivity . \n \nIntroduction:  Carotid artery stenosis (CAS)  is a clinical condition characteri zed by the narrowing of the \ncarotid artery , which reduces blood supply to the brain. This condition  can impair  cognitive  and motor  \nfunctions due to decreased blood flow  over the long term  [1,2] . In the past, we and others have \ndemonstrated  that the fNIRS response to a vasoreactivity test  is sensitive to CAS severity  [3]. These \nstudies showed that delay s in the hemodynamic response to such tests  indicate  deficits in cerebrovascular \nreserve . However,  the mechanisms by which the brain compensates for this  reduced cerebrovascular \nreserve need to be better  understood. I n this work , we analy zed the hemodynamic functional networks \nduring a vasoreactivity test in CAS patients to better understand the interaction among brain regions in \nthe condition of a  reduced cerebrovascular reserve associated with CAS.  \n \nMethods: A total of 50 patients diagnosed with CAS and 20 age -matched control s performed a \nvasoreactivity test of breath -holding. Patients were categori zed into five groups based on the  severity of \nCAS , ranging from 1  (low) to 5 (severe ). The experimental protocol consisted of  7 trials of breath-holding \nfor 10 seconds, with 30 s rest  periods  between trials. fNIRS data were acquired with a commercial \ncontinuous -wave device (NIRScout, NIRx) with 14 sources and 30 detectors , resulting in 48 source -\ndetector pairs that cover ed most of the anterior cerebral region . Data processing was conducted using \nhomemade scripts based on HomER2  [4] and comprised motion artifact correction, conversion to \nhemoglobin concentration, band -pass filtering in the region of low -frequency oscillations  (0.008 –0.15 \nHz), and pre-whitening . Functional connectivity was assessed using cross -correlation to determine  the \nmaximum similarity in transit times of hemoglobin oscillations  across different brain regions . We then \ncomputed metrics from graph theory to characteri ze the functional brain network during breath -holding . \n \nResults: Our findings reveal a highly interconnected network during breath -holding across all groups , \nwith most correlation coefficients above 0.5 . The average time for the network to reach its maximum \nconne ction, however, increased with CAS severity, reaching an  average delay  (standard deviation ) of 0.09 \n(0.19) s, and 0.08 (0.14) s for the most severe groups . When no delay was considered, the severe group \nshowed a lower density of connectivity than the mild CAS patients (degree density = 0.65 vs 1.0), with \nthe existing connections (node strength = 5.4 (1.4) vs 8.5 (0.4)).  This pattern led to lower clustering (0.67 \n(0.12) vs  1.0 (0.0)) and efficiency (0.83 vs 1.0) in the severe group when compared to the mild group. The \nmost impacted areas in the severe group were the  left frontal hemisphere and right \nPoscentr al/Supramarginal/Temporal region .  \n   \nConclusion:  Our analysis using fNIRS -based functional brain network s reinforces  that CAS disrupts the  \nfunctional hemodynamic integration of the brain, leading to lower  network efficiency in responding  to \nbreath -holding. Th e network architecture is recovered after a  delay , which appears to depend on C AS \nseverity.  \n \nReferences : [1] Asllani, I. , et al. Neuroimage -Clinical  (2016).  [2] Marshall, R.

There is a need for a non -\ninvasive bedside monitor of brain water content  to improve the diagnosis of edema and to assess the efficacy of \ntreatments aimed at reducing edema. Broadband near -infrared spectroscopy (bbNIRS) is a non -invasive optical \nmodality that enables quantification of  water content ; however, t he sensitivity of these measures to brain  water content \nin adult s has yet to be demonstrated .  \nMethods: Comparison with MRI: In 3 healthy and 2 brain injured adults, b ilateral bbNIRS -measures of brain water \ncontent over the frontal cortex were made at 3.5 cm with a handheld sensor  and calibration with frequency domain \nNIRS , as in 1. MRI maps of brain water content  were acquired within 1h of bbNIRS with a  long-TR multiple -echo \ngradient -echo sequence2. To compare MRI with bbNIRS , the average MRI -measured cerebral water content  was \nestimated within a spherical region of interest (radius = 2 cm) encompassing the approximate frontal volume \n(cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter) interrogated by bbNIRS . Spearman’s correlation coefficient  (Rs) \nwas used to assess the correlation between MRI and bbNIRS  water estimates . Influence of  edema therapy : In 4 brain \ninjured patients undergoing hyperosmolar therapy for suspected edema  (16.4 -23.4% hypertonic  saline) , a unilateral \nbbNIRS  sensor (3.5 cm source -detector separation ) was strapped to the forehead  for continuous monitoring  (0.2 Hz) \n~5 minutes before treatment (baseline) , during  (~20 min) , and for  60 min post -infusion . The modified Beer -Lambert \nlaw was used  to quantify  changes in  brain water  (%) from baseline, pre -treatment levels .  \nResults: Cerebral water content measured with bbNIRS was significantly positively correlated with MRI values (Rs \n= 0.83, p = 0. 02, N=8, Fig. 1A ). bbNIRS underestimated water content (Water bbNIRS  = 1.3*Water MRI -76), presumably  \ndue to skull contamination . As expected, h yperosmolar therapy decreased brain water conte nt in all patients  (Fig 1B) , \nalthough the magnitude  of therapeutic effect varied by patient .  \nConclusion:  We take the first steps to demonstrate feasibility of bbNIRS as a non -invasive tool to assess cerebral \nwater content  in adults by showing correlation with  MRI  and demonstrating measurable decreases in brain water with \nedema treatment . \nRecruitment for this study is \nongoing  and we anticipate \nmany more subjects before \nSeptember.  \nReferences  \n1.

However, the impact of  \nhypotension on cerebral metaboli sm remains unclear . This study measured  changes in two metabolic \nmarkers  acquired with a hyperspectral NIRS/DCS system : the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen \n(CMRO 2) and the oxidation state of cytochrome -c-oxidase (oxCCO) during 49 hypotensive events \nacross 32 patients  undergoing CPB . A linear relationship was demonstrated between MAP and both \nΔoxCCO and ΔCMRO 2. Similarly, a linear correlation characterized the relationship between the \ntwo metabolic markers.  \nIntroduction:  During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), clinicians utilize mean arterial pressure  (MAP) t argets to \nensure sufficient cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, cerebral autoregulation may be impaired  in up to 20% of \npatients1, rendering them susceptible to cerebral hypoperfusion and potential brain injury. A point -of-care method of \nassessing the severity of hypoperfusion is highly  desirable  to determine if such hypoperfusion is sufficient to impair \ncerebral metabolism , an indicator of brain ischemia . Hyperspectral near -infrared spectroscopy (hsNIRS ) combined \nwith diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) provides the means  to me asure both the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen \n(CMRO 2) and the oxidation state of cytochrome -c-oxidase (oxCCO)  intraoperative ly.2 This study aim ed to \ncharacterize the changes in CMRO 2 and oxCCO during hypotensive episodes in adult patients undergoing cardiac \nsurgery with CPB and to investigate the relationship between these two metabolic markers.  \nMethods:  32 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were continuously monitored using an in -house built \nhybrid multi -distance hsNIRS/DCS system3. A hypotensive event was defined as a period beginning with a decrease \nin MAP and ending with a nadir where MAP <  60 mmHg4. Metabolic changes ( ΔCMRO 2 and ΔoxCCO ) during \nhypotensive events were grouped into MAP bins of 5 mmHg ranging from 20 to 80 mmHg . \nResults: Average duration  of hypotensi on (49 \nin total)  was 5.3±3.5  min, with a MAP  decrease  \nof 33±16 mmHg ( -45± 18%)  from baselines . \nGreater reduction in ΔoxCCO and ΔCMRO 2 \nwere found with successive  decrease s in MAP , \n(Figure a) . Changes in oxCCO and CMRO 2 for \nMAP  < 40 mmHg were significantly lower \nthan baseline ( p < 0.05). Furthermore, changes \nin CMRO 2 and oxCCO showed a moderate \npositive correlation ( R2 = 0.56, p < 0.05, Figure b).  \nConclusion:  The observed relationship between MAP and both CMRO 2 and oxCCO  during hypotension demonstrates  \nthat the two metabolic markers are correlated , indicating either marker can be used for metabolic monitoring during \nsurgery.  The significant reductions in CMRO 2 and oxCCO  for MAP < 40 mmHg , indicate that cerebral metabolism \ncan be altered by hypotensive events during surgery, highlighting the importance of maintaining adequate  oxygen \ndelivery . The magnitude of these changes were comparable to reductions reported  in a previous stud y involving an \nanimal model of transient global ischemia2. \nReferences  \n1. Ono, M et al.

Results demonstrate the feasibility of \nthis technology for continuous bedside neuromon itoring of  brain health . \nIntroduction:  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides support for severe respiratory or cardiac \nfailure. ECMO patients are at risk for  neurologic  injury , and conventional neuroimaging methods  face limitations; \nthus there is a clear need for  neuromonitoring with high sensitivity  and specificity. Herein, we  establish the feasibility \nof high -density diffuse optical to mography (HD -DOT) for  neuromonitoring i n pediatric ECMO patients . \nMethods:  We used an HD -DOT system opt imized for pediatric patients with 80 dual -wavelength sources (685nm & \n830nm) and 78 avalanche -photodiode detectors that  support 1335  measurements per wavelengt h. HD-DOT data were \nbandpass filtered at low bandwidths (0.009 -0.08 Hz) for analysis of low frequency temporal correlation.  \nResults:  We present example results  for a two week old  ECMO  patient  over a 2 -hour period including a clamp trial  \n(Fig. 1). Clamp trials are p re-planned periods of separation from ECMO  to assess  the patient’s readiness  to come off \nECMO .

However, we posited that the cognitive functions of gifted children and of ADHD children \nwere different. We assessed more than one hundred typically developing children, including twenty -\nthree children whose full -scale intelligent quotients were  higher than 130. Activation in the right \nIFG and MFG during a Go/No -go task was distinct for children in the extremely -high-IQ group. \nThis may be useful as a neuro -functional biomarker towards the prevention of misdiagnosis between \nchildren with extremely  high IQs and ADHD children . \n \nIntroduction:  Children with extremely high intelligence, often called “gifted children”, are known to have \noutstanding abilities in certain fields, while often exhibiting specific characteristics such as overexcitability. Beca use \nof their behavioral similarities to children with attention -deficit/hyperacticity disorder (ADHD), they are frequently \nmisdiagnosed with ADHD. Therefore, we focused on a cognitive neuroscience approach to develop a method for \ndiscriminating gifted chil dren from ADHD children based on possible differences in cognitive functions between them.  \n \nMethods :  Our previous studies showed that the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) \nactivated in typically developing children performing a Go/No -go task, whereas there was no activation for ADHD \nchildren. In our present study, we recru ited 105 typically developing children aged six to fourteen years and divided \nthem into two groups: children whose full -scale intelligence quotients (FSIQ) were 130 or higher (extremely -high-IQ \ngroup) and those whose FSIQ was less than 130 (around -average -IQ group). Using the same version of the Go/No -go \ntask as in our previous studies, we used functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine whether or not \nchildren with extremely high intelligence exhibit cortical activation patterns similar to tho se of ADHD children.  \n \nResults:  Our results revealed that the cortical activation in the region of interest, the right IFG and MFG, was \nsignificant or marginally significant for both groups. This reveals that the children in the extremely -high-IQ group \nexhibited a different activation pattern than did the ADHD children in our previous studies, who exhibited reduced \nright IFG and MFG activation. Moreover, unlike the around -average -IQ group, the extremely -high-IQ group had a \nmoderate negative correlation b etween cortical activation in the ROI and FSIQ score. In our exploratory analysis, only \nthe extremely -high-IQ group had regional activation in the right prefrontal cortex and reduced activation in the left \nprefrontal cortex. These results are consistent wi th the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence explaining brain \nactivation in children with extremely high intelligence.  \n \nConclusion:  In conclusion, we demonstrated that cortical activation patterns for children with FSIQ scores of 130 or \nhigher were clearly different from those of ADHD children. Since our fNIRS -based experimental paradigm is highly \napplicable to individual children, our  findings may provide a useful method for avoiding misdiagnoses and identi fying \ninvisible intellectual giftedness.  \n \n 30 of 398",

Fallon1,2,3  \n \n1 The Bionics Institute, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia  \n2 Medical Bionics Department, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia  \n3 Department of Otolaryngology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia  \nPresenting Author: mshoushtarian@bionicsinstitute.org  \n \nAbstract:  Tinnitus, hearing  sounds not present externally, is a debilitating condition. In individuals \nwith cochlear implants  (CI), use of the impla nt is known to modulate tinnitus. We investigated how \nchanges in brain networks with CI use were  associated with changes in tinnitus perception . We \nrecorded fNIRS  at rest (CI turned on and off ), from 14 CI users who experienced tinnitus. Changes \nin subjective ratings of tinnitus loudness were significantly correlated with changes in diversity \ncoefficient, a measure of neural synchrony.  Better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying \ntinnitus modulation  with CI use, could pave the way for stimulation as a tinnitus treatment.   \n \nIntroduction:  Tinnitus affects around 15% of adults and can lead to symptoms such as depression and inability to \nengage in standard living tasks (1).  In individuals with cochlear implants (CI) who also experience tinnitus, use of a \nCI for hearing loss is known to modulate tinnitus  (2), often improving symptoms but worsening them in some cases. \nLittle is known about underlying cortical changes with use of the implant, which lead to changes in tinnitus perception. \nWe investigated whether changes in brain networks with the CI turned on and off, were associated with changes in \ntinnitus perception, as rated subjectively.  \nMethods: Using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we recorded cortical activity at rest, from 14 CI users \nwho experienced tinnitus. fNIRS signals  were recorded using  a NIRScout system (NIRx Medical Technologies LLC) \nwith 16 sources and 16 detectors placed over the frontal, left and right temporal, and occipital cortical regions.  \nRecordings were performed with the CI turned off and on. For each condition, participants rated the loudness and \nannoyance of their tinnitus using a visual rating scale. Changes in neural synchrony have been reported in humans and \nanimal models of tinnitus  (3). To assess neural synchrony, functional connectivity networks with the CI turned on and \noff, were compared using a network feature  called  diversity coefficient  which quantifies the distribution of a n fNIRS  \nchannel’s connections with other channels (4).  \nResults: Changes in tinnitus loudness , as rated subjectively, were \nsignificantly correlated with changes in diversity coefficient averaged \nacross all channels (𝑟=−0.79,𝑝<0.001). More distributed \nconnectivity with the CI on, compared to off, was associated with a \nreduction in tinnitus loudness.  \nConclusion:  Participants who experienced a reduction of loudness with \ntheir CI on, showed higher diversity coefficient with the implant on \ncompared to when it was turned off. Higher values in th is measure  \nsuggest more distributed connectivity is associated with lower tinnitus \nloudness . A better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying \ntinnitus suppression with CI use, could assist in developing stimulation \nstrategies for tinnitus suppression.  \nReferences   \n1.

    "Wearable whole-head HD-DOT of the adult brain \n \nE.E. Vidal-Rosas1,2, R.J. Cooper2,3, N.L. Everdell3,4, S. Powell3,4 \n \n1Digital Health and Biomedical Engineering Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK; \n2DOT-HUB, UCL, UK; 3Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL, UK; 4Gowerlabs Ltd., London, UK \nPresenting Author email address: e.e.vidal-rosas@soton.ac.uk \n \nAbstract:  We introduce a development of our wearable high-density diffuse optical tomography \nplatform that provides whole-head coverage of the adult brain. We validate the system (N=20) using \nthe resting-state paradigm and a series of simultaneously applied cognitive tasks (visual, auditory, \nsomatosensory, motor and language). The statistical analysis provides confirmatory evidence that \nthe system is capable of  whole-head, high-density imaging in a wearable form factor. \n \nIntroduction:  High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) has the potential to become an effective alternative \nneuroimaging modality to traditional fMRI or PET, particularly in situations where these methods are contraindicated or \nwhere patient motion is difficult to avoid. HD-DOT has undergone intensive validation in recent years, but existing \ndevices have limited fields of view, and no whole-head validation has been achieved. Here, we evaluate the performance \nof a whole-head HD-DOT system using a battery of classic paradigms applied simultaneously. \nMethods:  The whole-head cap (LUMO, Gowerlabs Ltd.) consists of 162 sources and 216 detectors for a total of  >30K \nchannels. We applied two protocols: (1) simultaneous visual stimulation (eccentricity mapping), auditory and \nsomatosensory stimulation (Fig. 1a-b); and (2) simultaneous visual (polar mapping) and motor (finger tapping) \nstimulation. Additional paradigms undertaken include resting-state mapping and verbal fluency. Concentration images \ndue to each stimulus were obtained using a GLM approach. Paired-sample, two-tailed t-tests were used to calculate T-\nstatistic maps that compared the baseline to the HRF peak ± 2 seconds for all the conditions and across all the participants. \nResults: T-statistic maps for the visual stimuli based on ΔHbO (Fig. 1c-f) present bilateral activations; however, the \nstrongest response is contralateral to the stimulus as expected. The T-statistic maps for the left-auditory stimulus (Fig. \n1g) indicate significant concentration changes in the contralateral auditory cortex, but the right-auditory stimuli elicited \nbilateral activations (Fig. 1h). This is not unexpected considering the strong crossed pathways between the ear and the \nauditory cortex1 (i.e. each hemisphere receives input from both ears). The T-statistic maps for the somatosensory stimuli \n(Fig. 1i-j) show significant increases in the postcentral gyri contralateral to the stimuli, while the motor task (Fig. 1k-l) \nshow broader contralateral activation \nspanning the posterior precentral gyri \nand the postcentral gyri. The motor \ntask activated the somatosensory \ncortex since the touch sense is \ninvolved during finger tapping as a \nfeedback mechanism (see Fig. 1m-n). \nConclusion:  The activation maps are \nlargely consistent with the findings of \nestablished neuroimaging modalities \n(fMRI, PET). Using novel \nsimultaneously-applied classic \nfunctional stimulation paradigms, \nthis work demonstrates whole-head \nHD-DOT in adults for the first time. \nThe capacity to image the whole of \nthe accessible cortex in a portable \ndevice represents a step-change in \nour capacity to study human brain \nfunction, particularly in more \necologically valid paradigms.  \n[1] Sininger, Y.S. et al.

The aim of our studies was to \ncomprehensively investigate  the effects of different colored light conditions  on cerebral \nhemodynamics , oxygenation  and systemic physiology  using  systemic physiology augmented \nfunctional near -infrared spectroscopy (SPA -fNIRS) approach . We found that colored light  has \nrelatively long -lasting effects on cerebral and systemic physiology in humans . Our observations \nrevealed different  physiological responses in healthy adults. Machine learning enabled us to classify \nthese response patterns . \n \nIntroduction:  Colored light exposure (CLE) is an everyday experience. In our modern society, we are increasingly \nexposed to various sources of colored light, from advertisements to computer and smartphone displays to light from \nenergy -saving light bulbs, private settings , and street lighting with LEDs. Therefore, the effects of colored light on \nhuman physiology are of increasing interest to both the research community and society.  To elucidate the intricate \neffects of CLE in humans, we have conducted several leading studies (with results published in 18 papers) over the \nlast 7 years  using the SPA -fNIRS approach.  We aimed to summarize the key findings of our previous studies \ninvestigating the effects of CLE on cerebral and human physiology using the SPA -fNIRS approach.  \n \nMethods: 220 healthy right -handed adults  were recruited for 22 different colored light conditions. Using SPA -fNIRS \nneuroimaging, each subject was measured 2 -4 times on different days , resulting in 708 single measurements.  The \nSPA-fNIRS  approach allows simultaneous measurement of brain activity measurement using fNIRS  (frequency \ndomain NIRS; Imagent, ISS Inc, Champaign, IL, USA)  alongside multiple systemic physiological parameters.  We \nsimultaneously assessed the effects of CLE in the visual cortex (VC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and systemic physiology.  \nSubject s were  continuously exposed to  CLE (e.g., blue,  red, green  and yellow ) for 15 min in a randomized crossover \nprotocol . Before (baseline, 8 min) and after (recovery, 20 min) the CLE subjects were in darkness.  In some studies, \nwe asked our subjects to perform  a cognitive task (e.g., verbal fluency task  (VFT)  and 2 -back task) while they were \nexpos ed to the CLE.  \n \nResults: In our studies, (i ) we discovered the need for both group -level and individual -level analyses to fully \nunderstand the effects of CLE on human physiology. We found that (ii) CLE has relatively long -lasting effects on \nhuman cerebral and systemic physiology. Color -dependent changes were evident in the recovery phase of several \nsystemic physiological parameters . (iii) Compared to other colored lights, yellow and short -wavelength light  (e.g. \nblue)  led to higher brain activation in the PFC and VC, respectively. (iv) Our research u nderscores the inherent \nvariability between individual responses to CLE (inter -subject variability).  (v) A rterial oxygen saturation and mean \narterial pressure were positively correlated with oxygenated hemoglobin  in the PFC during the CLE -VFT . (vi)  CLE \nsequence -dependent effects were observed for fNIRS signals at the  VC and for electrodermal activity (vii) Individual -\nlevel analysis  revealed  different  responses among healthy adults. In particular, CLE with blue light resulted in  \ncerebrovascular hemodynamic response patterns that could be classified into eight types. Machine learning enabled \nus to classify the response patterns and provide new insights into the common response patterns between subjects.  \n \nConclusion:  In a civilization that is rapidly exposed to new and increasing lighting, the findings of this research are \nrelevant to the scientific community, medical professionals and society. Further research should clarify which color \nin CLE benefits whom. Leveraging nov el machine learning techniques with informative and distinct features from our \nrecorded SPA -fNIRS signals is crucial to answering this question.  33 of 398",

We present a  novel \nhigh-density (HD), multi -distance, hexagonal  array  and demonstrate improved ability to detect  \nsignificant activation in healthy adults  over that of a traditional sparse array  via direct comparison . \n \nIntroduction:  Stroop Task s are commonly paired with fNIRS to observe frontotemporal activation  and are \nspecifically applied to  probe psychiatric disorders1. fNIRS studies of Stroop -induced activation typically use sparse \ngrid-pattern optode arrays  across the frontal region , most commonly with standard 30mm source -detector separations . \nHowever,  sparse arrays are known to exhibit poor fNIRS signal  reproducability2 because of non -uniform spatial \nsampling.  Technology advancements now enable  multi -distance, high -density  (HD)  optode arrays  that improve \nmeasurement spatial sensitivity . This work direct ly compar es Word -Color Stroop ( WCS )-induced activation in \nhealthy subjects detect ed by both a traditional  sparse fNIRS array  and a multi -distance, high -density array to quantify \nthe e xpected improvements afforded by the HD array . \nMethods:  Two fNIRS probe arrays were populated with NIRSport 2 optodes : a single -distance (30mm), sparse grid-\npatter n and a multi -distance ( 19mm, 33mm), high -density hexagonal -pattern . 15 healthy adult subjects performed \nCongruent and Incongruent WCS3, once for each array . The order was randomized . We analyzed both group-average d \nactivation  and pairwise comparison of the activation . \nResults: After applying GLM,  a paired t -test is performed at \nthe subject -level to compare the pre -block periods and the \nWCS blocks , per array , in both channel - and image -space. \nThese subject -level t values are compared between arrays via  \na paired sample t -test of the maximum t -stat per subject . We \nfound statistically significant higher detection by the HD \narray over the Sparse array  during Incongruent WCS in the \nright ROI at the channel level.  Group -level t -maps for b oth \nthe Congruent and Incongruent WCS  demonstrate  that the \nHD array  better localizes the brain activation , and for \nCongruent the HD array captures much more activation than \ndoes the Sparse array.  \nConclusion:  This work direct ly compar es detection of \nfrontotemporal activation by sparse versus HD fNIRS array \nto lay groundwork for improving future studies probing \npsychiatric disorders with fNIRS and WCS. T hough a sparse \narray may suffice to capture significant activation for WCS, \nthe HD array detects more regionally -localized significant \nactivity for Incongruent WC S and  performs statistically \nbetter at the channel level for this condition and performs \nbetter than the Sparse array overall during Congruent WCS.  \nAcknowledgments:  Supported by NIH U01EB029856 .  \nReferences:  1.

However, this is particularly challenging in rapidly expanding, \ninternational fields su ch as the functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) \ncommunity that includes researchers with different backgrounds and fields of \napplications (e.g., engineering, sports sciences, neuroscience). Therefore, the \nfNIRS Glossary Project was es tablished to develop a community -sourced glossary \nrelating to fNIRS technology including, but not limited to, the technologies of \ncontinuous -wave (CW), frequency domain (FD) and time domain (TD) NIRS.  \n \nMethods:  The fNIRS Glossary Project was realized in 4 main project phases: 1) Drafting definitions: submission of \nat least 3 terms, their definitions and related symbols via a structured Google entry form by all team members (N = \n76) 2) Review and editing: each tea m member revised a minimum of fifteen term definitions, 3) Expert panel phase: \nExperts of the field (N = 20) review to further improve the definitions and resolve terms in conflict 4) Expert panel \nfeedback integration, creation of the online versi on under the openfnirs.org website and manuscript preparation and \nsubmission by the fNIRS Glossary Project core team.  \n \nResults: The fNIRS Glossary includes over 300 terms organized in 6 main categories: analysis, experimental design, \nhardware, neuroscience, math and physics. Additionally, the fNIRS Glossary includes: abbreviations or symbols, \nsynonyms, references as well as an alte rnative definition, if applicable, and figures (online version).  \n \nConclusion:  Building on the best practices for fNIRS publications paper [1] and the OntoNIRS project [2] the fNIRS \nGlossary Project provides a community -sourced resource to facilitate education and effective scientific \ncommunication within the fNIRS community and rela ted fields. We envisage that the glossary will lower the barrier \nto learn about fNIRS and engage in fNIRS related discussions. Therefore, this project will also benefit researchers \nfrom less represented backgrounds and disadvantaged socioeconom ic positions that may not have the same access to \neducational resources about fNIRS .  \n \nAcknowledgements:  This project  is inspired by the Glossary Project of the Framework for Open and Responsible \nResearch Training (FORRT).

    "Dynamics  of Inter-brain connectivity in Mother -Infant \nInteraction : Graph Theory Analysis \n \nMini Sharma1, Lindsey Riera -Gomez3, Jacqueline Hammack3, Teresa Wilcox3, Anat Dahan2 & Hila Gvirts1 \n1. Behavioral sciences Depa rtment , ariel University, Ariel, Israel  \n2. Braude  College of engineering, Karmiel, Israel  \n3. Department o f Psychology , Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton , FL, USA  \nMinisharmaa2 012@gmail.com  \nAbstract:  This study used graph theory analysis to explore connectivity patterns in mother -infant \ninteractions via fnirs hyperscanning. Fourteen infants  participated in free-play and instructed \nsynchronization tasks w earing  fNIRS caps. The Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) displayed higher \nconnectivity strength in both tasks, indicating its role in communication and coordination. Notably, \nthe Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG -L) and Middle Temporal Gyrus (MTG -L) exhibited increased \nconnectivity in the instructed task, suggesting enhanced information flow. The instructed task \nfostered a more integrated and efficient network, while the free -play task revealed a distinct pattern. \nThese findings enhance  understanding of mother -infant interaction and underscore the  inter-brain \nconnectivity  dynamic s. \nIntroduction : Hyperscanning studies have primarily focused on bivariate analysis techniques to examine neural \ncoupling between interacting brains. However, the multivariate nature of brain interaction is often overlooked. This \nstudy emphasizes the importance of employin g multivariate analysis, specifically graph theory, to capture complex \ninter-brain connectivity. By analyzing fnirs hyperscanning data, we aimed to quantify connectivity patterns and nodal \nstrength in mother -infant interactions. Global measures such as Glo bal efficiency, Modularity, and Inter -brain density \nwere used to assess network organization and communication patterns.  \nMethods: Fourteen infants (7 -23 months) wore identical fNIRS caps in two tasks: free -play and instructed \nsynchronization. In free -play, mothers interacted with their infants using toys naturally. In instructed \nsynchronization, mothers synchronized behaviors with th eir infants using provided toys . \nDuring both tasks, functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and video recordings were simultaneously \ncollected for a duration of 4 minutes . Graph theory parameters  (nodal strength,  global efficiency , modularity,  and \ninter-brain density ) were utilized. Nodes in the graph were defined as the channels representing the brain activity of \nboth the mother and the infant. The edge weights in the graph were determined by calculating the Pearson \ncorrelation coefficients between the corresponding ch annels of the mother and the infant. This resulted in a 36x36 \nundirected weighted connection matrix, where each element represented the correlation coefficient between a pair of \nnodes.  Global Network Efficiency, Modularity, and inter -brain density  were computed on the undirected weighted \nconnection matrix . Strength measure  quantified the nodal connectivity strength betw een the mother and infant in the \ninter-brain network.   \nResults: Findings demonstrate that in the hyperbrain network at the nodal level during mother -child interactions, the \nInferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) exhibits higher connectivity  strength  in both the freeplay and instructed task conditions. \nSpecifically, the IFG shows stronger connectivity for the Infant in both conditions .  \nHowever, in the instructed task, the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG -L) and Middle Temporal Gyrus (MTG -L) also \nexhibit increased connectivity strength . The global measures of connectivity revealed that the instructed task \nexhibited decreased modularity, increased global efficiency, and higher interbrain density compared to the freeplay \ntask. Conversely, the free -play task demonstrated higher modularity, indicating the presence of distinct and separate \nmodules within the network . \nConclusion:  Study highlights  the significance of multivariate  analysis, specifically graph theory, in understanding \ninter-brain connectivity during mother -infant interactions . The IFG emerged as a key region facilitating \ncommuni cation and coordination  between mother and infant.  The role of STG -L and MTG -L in instructed task \nindicate that during goal -oriented tasks  (instructed t ask), different brain regions assume distinct roles, whereas \nduring freeplay, a form of spontaneous synchrony occurs, facilitated by the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)  is the most \nprominent  region , promoting communication between mother and infant.  \nSuggested  by the glo bal measures  (Global efficiency, Modularity,  and Inter -brain density ), in the instructed task, the \nnetwork becomes more integrated and efficient, facilitating enhanced information flow and coordination between \nthe mother and infant . Conversely, the freeplay task demonstrated higher modularity, indicating the presence of \ndistinct and separate modules within the network.  \n \n 36 of 398",

We present  high-fidelity task-based functional localizer  maps derived from data collected \nfrom 5  subjects using a precision -focused protocol on High -Density Diffuse Optical Tomography \n(HD-DOT)  to reduce intersession variability . This project establishes methodological improvements \ntoward reproducibility of task and resting -state functional connectivity maps at an individual level , \nhighlighting  subject -specific features not captured by group -level analysis.  \n \nIntroduction:  Precision functional mapping  takes a subject -specific approac h to localiz e spatial and organizational \nvariability  in neuroimaging data  (Gordon et.al, 2017, Neuron) . This entails  gathering extensive data from a few \nsubjects  across multiple sessions . While well-known  in fMRI literature, this approach is still emerging in optical \nneuro imaging.  This study  aims to demonstrate  the efficacy of HD-DOT to produce  high-fidelity tomographic \nreconstructions of neuronal activity , highlight ing advancements  in precision -based method ologies . Our imaging \nsystem  comprises  128 sources and 125 detectors,  facilitating  over 2500 measurements  and delivering state-of-the-art \nHD-DOT image quality with extended cortical coverage (Fig 1A) . Unlike fMRI, HD -DOT offers a notable advantage \nin conducting longer scans, with subjects comfortably  seated  in a quiet and naturalistic environment . \nMethods: We collected 4 to 6 hours of data from 5 subjects (3M,  2F) using previously validated  tasks (retinotopy , \nhearing words , finger tapping/tongue movement , and generating verbs ) and resting -state paradigms  over 6 to 9 \nsession s. Data was processed using the NeuroDOT toolbox  (Eggebrecht et.al ., 2014 , Nat.Photonics ), followed by a \nvoxel -wise general linear model to estimate task -related responses .  \nResults: Fig 1B show s average activation across all task sessions for each subject  overlaid on subject -specific  \nstructural MR  images . Resting -state functional connectivity (RSFC) maps were generated  by placing a seed in the \nvisual, auditory, motor, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and default mode networks. Fig 1C  shows  the change in \ncorrelation between RSFC \nmaps generated from \nconcatenated data sessions \nwith smaller windows of this \ndata for a single  subject. The \noverarching premise of \nprecision mapping suggests \nthat the se maps achieve \ngreater stability with \nincreased  number of trials or \ndata duration .  \nConclusion:  Our study d emonstrate s the feasibility of using  a precision approach in  HD-DOT to obtain high-fidelity \nsingle -subject brain maps. Moving forward, our next objective is to validate the fidelity of activation maps across a \nbroader range of functional localizers and establish metrics determining the amount of data needed to generate reliable \nmaps . This will facilitate using these maps to monito r changes in  individual -level  functional brain activity . \nDisclaimer:  Funded by NIH grants U01EB027005, R01NS109487, T32EB014855.

    "Neurological Impacts of Yoga Asana: An fNIRS study  \n \nMichelle Goodricka, Eleazar Samuel Kolosovas -Machucaa,b and Edgar Guevaraa,c \n \na CIACYT -UASLP , Mexico b Falculty of Science UASLP , Mexico c CONA HCYT- UASLP , Mexico  \nA363216@alumnos.uaslp.mx   \n \nAbstract:  The practice of Yoga Asana has been observed to relieve symptoms associated with \nanxiety and depression  and this study offers neurological insight into the se psychological \nimprovements. Applying functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) changes in prefrontal cortex \n(PFC) activity of 27 healthy adults during and after executing 4 Yoga Asanas for 23 minutes was \nmeasured . Results demonstrated all Asanas significantly increased PFC activity particularly in the \nright hemisphere whereas analysis of resting state functional connectivity post -yoga practice \nshowed a significant decrease mainly in the left PFC  amongst network connections previously \nestablished as being hyperactive in patients suffering from mood disorders.  \n \nIntroduction:  Yogic texts claim that thought patterns and mood can be altered via the practice of physical forms \nknown as Asana1 and there is increasing research supporting the positive impact of Yoga practices in relieving \nsymptoms of depression and anxiety2. Nonetheless the neuro logical  mechanisms under lying these results are not \nclearly understood  due to reduced sample sizes, variations in methodology and previously available technology . \nTherefore, fNIRS neuroimaging technology was applied to document the neurological effects of four specific Yoga \nAsana s during and post -practice on pre -frontal cortex brain activity with a robust sample size.  \nMethods: 27 healthy individuals (n = 20 female; age = 39 ± 12.3 years) with 0 -10 years of Yoga experience  \nparticipated in the analysis. Researchers employed the portable fNIRS system Brite MKII (Artinis , NL ) to measure \nchanges in HbO , HbR  and HbT . V olunteers were instructed to follow a power point presentation with photos and \nnames of the four targeted Asanas  written below as the following:  Baseline Posture A (Tadasana), Posture B \n(Uttanasana), Posture C (Adho Mukah Savasana) and Posture C (Urdhva Mukah Savasana). The screen  changed \nautomatically and randomly every 30 seconds  with the name of the posture stated out loud . 8 measurements for \npostures B, C and D were taken and compared to baseline posture A which was repeated 25 – 30 seconds between \neach Asana . 6 minutes resting state measurements were taken before and after the Yoga Asana practice with \nparticipants sitting in a chair with their eyes closed. Data were analyzed using MATLAB . The General Linear Model \n(GLM) with a t -range of 2.0 before stimulus onset and 23.00 seconds after stimulus onset  was applied to regress out \nsystemic physiology from brain activity and determ ine the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ). Origin  (Pro) was \nused to complete a one -way repeated measures ANOV A  for Yoga Asana . Motion artifacts were regressed out applying  \nthe regularized temporally embedded Canonical Correlation Analysis (tCCA)3. Resting state functional connectivity \n(rsFC) was determined using a bandpass filtering \nprocess after completing motion artifact correction . \nResults: Compared to  baseline posture A,  execution \nof Postures  B, C and D resulted in  significant \nincrease s of activity in the PFC, with the greatest \neffect being observed in the right  hemisphere  (figure \n1). In contrast, the rsFC observed post Yoga Asana \ndemonstrated a significant reduction of connectivity \nmainly limited to the left medial PFC (figure  2). \nConclusion:  According to  Jobson et.al.4,  mPFC  \nfunctional connectivity appears to be consistently \ncorrelated with alterations in the default modal network  (DMN) . Hyperactivity of this network is correlated with \nanxiety and is one of the most consistent findings regarding the physiopathology of depression5. Therefore, it is \nhypothesized  that the practice of Yoga Asana improv es psychological mood states by first increasing  HbO in the PFC \nwhich then rebounds and results  in a reduction of  rsFC of  the mPFC  and the inferred DMN network  connections . \n \n1 Iyengar, B.

Sensorimotor  activation was measured during postural \ncontrol conditions with eyes opened/closed and/or un/stable ground . Symptomatic concussed \nathletes were characterized by decreased balance  and increased brain activation in the Post Central \nGyrus, Superior Parietal Lobe, and Supramarginal Gyrus  during  eyes closed and on unstable surface  \nconditions , when  compared to asymptomatic and non -concussed participants . Therefore, increased \nsensorimotor neural activity  cannot compensate  for impaired postural control functions in concussed \nand symptomatic athletes . \nIntroduction:  Concussion is recognized as a form of traumatic brain injury, manifesting various short - and long -term \nhealth implications.  Balance deterioration have been observed after a concussive injury (Guskiewicz K. M. , 2011).  \nStudies have suggested that concussions can lead to abnormal functioning of the  motor cortex (De Beaumont L. , \net.al.,2007 ). We therefore hypothesized that  individuals who have suffered a concussion will demonstrate poorer \nbalance performance and exhibit altered motor cortex function  compared to individuals without a history of \nconcussion . \nMethods: 66 participants were classified based on concussion occurrence and Post -Concussion Symptom Scale \n(PCSS) scores: PCSS>10  (concussed symptomatic) , PCSS≤10 (concussed asymptomatic) , and a control cohort devoid \nof concussion history. Postural stability and sensorimotor  brain activation were evaluated utilizing a pressure platform \nand functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS ) over the somatosensory and motor cortex  of each hemisphere . \nFour conditions were employed during  postural stability assessments: eyes open on stable surface, eyes closed on \nstable surface, eyes open on unstable surface, and eyes closed on unstable surface, with each condition comprising six \ntrials of 10 seconds each.  \nResults: Within the eyes open  and un/ stable condition, the PCSS>10 group exhibited significantly  higher area of \nwhere the center of pressure is likely to be 95% of the time , as compared to the PCSS≤10 group  and the control group.  \nThe PCSS>10 group showed a significantly higher changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (∆HbO 2) in the Supramarginal \nGyrus of the left and right hemisphere during eyes open and on unstable surface conditions  when compared to the \nPCSS≤10 and the control group . For the eyes closed and on un/ stable surface condition, the PCSS>10 group showed \nsignificantly higher ∆HbO 2 in the Post Central Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobe and Supramarginal Gyrus  of the left \nhemisphere when compared to the PCSS≤10 and the control group.  \nConclusion:  Symptomatic athletes were  characterized by  poor balance  functions  and higher neural activity  in the \nsomatosensory and motor cortex  as compare d to asymptomatic and non-concussed athletes . In contrast to p revious \nstudies that showed that symptomatic athletes are characterized by a lack of activation in frontopolar cortices during \npostural control  (Helmich I. et. al., 2020) , the present results  indicate d that there is an increase in the neural activity  \nin sensory -motor and superior parietal cortices.  The increased activation can potentially su ggest a compensatory \nmechanism happening in the brain to counteract the deficits arising from a concussive injury.  However , our results \ndemonstrated that it  cannot compensate  for the  impaired postural control functions in concussed and symptomatic \nathletes.   \n \nReferences:  \n1.

We found PD patients have significantly lower clustering coefficients and small-\nworld indices over a wide range of sparsity thresholds, indicating a less efficient motor network, \nsupported by network-based statistics showing a disconnected bilateral subnetwork. These findings \nunderscore the potential of fNIRS in understanding PD neural basis, highlighting significant \nalterations in motor cortex connectivity and organization, and suggesting a path for future research \ninto the condition's neurological underpinnings.  \n \nIntroduction:  Mapping brain networks has been traditionally carried out with PET & fMRI. However, both \nprocedures are not completely suitable for patients with PD, who may have difficulty remaining still or have deep \nbrain devices not compatible with fMRI1. To overcome these limitations, our work aimed to use fNIRS to explore the \nimpact of PD on the small-world characteristics of the motor cortex's neural networks during resting state, focusing \non functional connectivity (FC) and graph theory parameters. \n \nMethods: We used fNIRS (22 long + 2 short channels Fig1a) to cover bilateral motor regions of 20 PD patients and \n20 matched controls (age=65.6±9.9, UPDRS-3=37.4±18.4 and disease duration=8.2±3.8). A graph theoretical network \nanalysis was applied to examine network topology and specific sub-networks. The clustering coefficient (CC) and \nsmall-world index (SWI) were computed. Network-based statistics were used to identify differences in connectivity2 \nand Pearson’s correlation between mean FC and graph \ntheory metrics. \n \nResults: PD patients exhibited lower CC (p=0.035, \nd=0.72 (c)) and SWI (p=0.38, d=0.69 (d)) compared to \ncontrols, indicating disrupted motor cortex connectivity. \nA specific disconnected bilateral subnetwork was \nidentified in PD patients, with 9 edges (t=3.79, p=0.001, \ncorrected (e)) highlighting alterations in FC. A \nsignificant positive correlation was found between the \nmean FC of that subnetwork and the CC and SWI (f). \n \nConclusion:  fNIRS demonstrates significant potential \nfor revealing the neural basis of motor function \nimpairments in PD, highlighting altered motor cortex \nconnectivity as a fundamental aspect of the disease's \nneurological impact.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nCONAHCYT Frontier Science project 20884 & IxM \nprogram project 528.  \n \nReferences  \n1 Devezas, M.

Van \nde Vliet5 \n1Smith College, Northampton, MA, USA   \n2Department of Motor Behavior in Sports, German Sport University (GSU), Germany  \n3Institute of Biomechanics and Orthopaedics, GSU Cologne, Germany  \n4Department of Biomechanics, University of Nebraska at Omaha, USA  \n5Immune -Oncological Centre Cologne, Germany  \nPresenting Author email address: i.helmich@dshs -koeln.de  \n \nAbstract:  Para swimmers with limb deficiency are faced with the situation that they must use their \nhead to finish  each competition by a hit to the wall. Repetitive head impacts may impair behavioral \nand brain functions. We  therefore investigated neurobehavioral functions of a Para swimmer with \ndysmelia before and after repetitive  head impacts (T1) and without (T2). Behavioral and brain \nfunctions decreased from pre to post at T1 but not at T2. Para swimmer s with limb deficiency are \ntherefore affected from similar  consequences onto brain health that are observed  after repeated \nsport -related concussions . \n \nIntroduction:  Repeated head impacts (RHI) in sports can impair brain health. The concussion experience of the Para \nathlete is unique, due to the interaction of the individual’s primary impairment and the pathophysiology of concussion. \nThe consensus statement of concussion in sports particularly points out that the heterogeneity of P ara athletes, by \nnature of impairment, implies case -by-case decisions in order to develop concussion protocols. We address this issue \nin a Para swimmer with limb deficiency due to dysmelia.  Para swimmer s with limb deficiency are faced with the \nsituation th at they must use their head to finish  each competition by a hit to the wall , which results in repetitive head \nimpacts. We therefore investigated if brain oxygenation patterns are affected from RHI in a Para swimmer with \ndysmelia.  \n \nMethods: We conducted two  measurements with a five -week interval (T1, T2)  in a professional Para swimmer with \ndysmelia . At both times we performed a concussion assessment protocol before (pre) and after (post) repeated \nswimming . At T1, swimming finished  as in real competitions: by hitting the head against the microchronometer \nattached to the wall of the swimming pool. At T2, the identical intervention protocol was performed but without head \ncollisions against the wall.  At T1 and at T2, we performed pre /  post measurements that have been previously used to \nassess post -concussion symptoms such as functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy ( fNIRS ), Working Memory tests, \nPost-Concussion Symptom assessments , and gestural analyses .  \n \nResults: Head collisions at T1 r esulted in a mean peak linear acceleration of 13.6 g ± 4.5. The individual reported a \nPCS score of 0 pre and 54 post the head acceleration. At T2, the individual did not report symptoms. The hand \nmovement frequency at T1 showed 6.9 left hand (lh) and 8.1 r ight hand (rh) movements before and 0.6 lh and 4.4 rh \nmovements after (at T2: pre 8.1 lh and 4.1 rh movements, post 7.2 lh and 7.8 rh movements). The individual reached \n92 % correct working memory (WM) scores  before and 71 % after head impacts at T1 (at T2 : pre 77 %, post 85 %). \n∆HbO2 during the WM task significant ly decrease d from pre to post at T1  in prefrontal cortices  but not at T2 . Node \nstrength also significant ly decrease d from pre to post at T1.  \n \nConclusion:  The present findings show that repeated head impacts in Para swimming with limb deficiency result in \nhigh impacts on the head, which is accompanied by reduced neurobehavioral functions.  FNIRS constitutes an \napplicable method for the investigation the impact of RHI in Para sports that ma y face similar consequences as athletes \nthat are affected from sport related concussions.  \n \n \nReference : Helmich I, Chang YY, Gemmerich R, Rodrigo L, Funken J, Arun KM, Van de Vliet P (2024) \nNeurobehavioral consequences of repetitive head impacts in Para swimming: a case report, Journal of Science and \nMedicine in Sport . 27(1):16 -19. doi: 10.1016/j.jsams.2023. 10.015.  \n  43 of 398",
    "The Utility of fNIRS for Evaluating Human Voice Acoustics \nfor Stress Management  \n \nMarina Saskovets1, Mykhailo Lohachov1, Zilu Liang1, Ian Piumarta1 \n \n1Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS), 18 Yamanouchi Gotanda -cho, Ukyo -ku, Kyoto 615 -8577, Japan,  \nPresenting Author email address:  2022md03@kuas.ac.jp  \n \nAbstract:  This study examined the utility of fNIRS in assessing soothing -voice -facilitated mental \nstress recovery. For this purpose, we measured the prefrontal cortex activity of 35 participants \nduring a stress task and its recovery phase. We used a soothing voice intervention during \nexperimental group recovery. Two control groups received a flat, robotic voice or silence to \ndistinguish the effects of voice stimulation from attention shifts to irrelevant sounds. Measurements \nof fNIRS and salivary cortisol s howed that stress markers dropped faster in the presence of a natural, \nsoothing voice compared to both controls.  \n \nIntroduction:  Sound is a powerful way to evoke emotions. There is a growing body of evidence that therapeutic \ninterventions delivered by hearing (e.g., nature sounds, music, or poetry therapy) are effective in reducing stress and \nanxiety (Mohammadian et al. 2011; Jabar outi & Shariat 2013; Noel 2010; Maess, Koelsch, et al. 2001). In this study, \nwe focus on the utility of fNIRS for evaluating human voice acoustics for stress management. Salivary cortisol levels \nwere considered as a ground truth for stress response trackin g. \n \nMethods:  Thirty -five healthy participants, between the ages of 18 and 35 were evaluated during a stress task and its \nrecovery. During the stress induction phase, participants were asked to do improvisation speech tasks in front of an \naudience (IMPRO). During the s tress recovery phase, participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. \nTwelve people were in the experimental group, listening to a human voice with a soothing intonation in an unfamiliar \nforeign language (Japanese). Twelve people we re in a control group, listening to silence (wearing muffler \nheadphones), and 11 people were in a second control group, listening to an emotionless, AI -synthesized, robotic voice. \nPrefrontal cortex (PFC) activity was measured during soothing voice interven tion (SVI) related to the stress task using \nan Aritinis Brite 24 system. Optodes were arranged on the scalp according to the 212 -channel template and distributed \nsymmetrically on the right and left sides of the frontal area. Half of the optodes were place d between the FpZ -F7-F3-\nFZ region, and another half - between the FpZ -F8-F4-FZ region according to the international 10 –20 EEG system. \nThis configuration is convenient for comparing activity in the two hemispheres and tracking frontal asymmetry as one \nof the markers of mental stress. Salivary cortisol levels were measured with the Soma -Cube system.  \n \nResults: There was significant right lateralization for \nΔO2Hb signals and significant cortisol increase in response \nto the IMPRO Stress Task (p < 0.05 ) for  all groups. \nAccording to mixed factorial ANOVAs, mean values of \nhemodynamic changes in the right PFC show a significant \ndifference between phases in the experimental group \nlistening to the soothing voice compared to groups receiving \nsilence or robotic voi ce (p < 0.05).  At the same time, cortisol \nlevels after sound intervention in the experimental group \ndecreased more significantly than in the control groups (p < \n0.01), as shown in Fig. 1. At the end of the experiment, \nsalivary cortisol levels returned to baseline in all groups.  \n \nConclusions:  Our results demonstrate the utility of fNIRS \nfor assessing both induced experimental stress and the \ntherapeutic, stress -relieving effects of the human voice. This \nopens the way for fNIRS as a validation technology for \nstudying affective speech communicati on in multiple \ndomains.   \nFig.1: Salivary cortisol levels in respon se to the \nstress task and sound intervention . \n44 of 398",

In this work, we aim to \nquantify this by running an fNIRS study  in a large cohort of diverse subjects with a wide ra nge of \nskin and hair properties. Our  multiple linear regression analysis  reveal ed that hair characteristics, \nspecifically  cumulative hair  thickness and hair color , as well as skin pigmentation  explain the \nvariability in several signal quality metrics for fNIRS such as Scalp Coupling Index and Peak \nSpectral Power . \nBackground : This study investigates the impact of hair and skin properties on the signal quality of functional Near -\nInfrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)  1, leveraging a diverse participant pool  (n = 115)  to provide a comprehensive analysis. \nRecognizing the influence of physical characteristics on fNIRS performance is crucial, especially in light of findings \nthat devices like pulse oximeters exhibit decreased efficacy with increased skin pigmentation  2. The objective of this \nwork is to delineate how variations in hair characteristics such as  density , thickness, and color , as well as skin \npigmentation, affect fNIRS data signal quality . This endeavor not only addresses concerns about inclusivity and \neffectiveness in neuroimaging but also aims to refine future device development for broader applicability.  \nMethods:  Participants underwent a series of tasks while fNIRS data were collected using a NIRx NIRSport2  system \n(NIRSport2, NIRx, Germany) , covering areas including the prefrontal, motor , and occipital cortices. Alongside, skin \npigmentation  (via Skintone Pen TPS20, Cologne, Germany])  and hair characteristics  (via Handyscope, Dermlite, \nCalifornia, USA, and FotoFinder, Bad Birnbach, Germany ) were quantitatively assessed, providing a nuanced \nunderstanding of their roles in signal variance.  \nResults: A multiple linear regression analysis  reveal ed that hair characteristics, specifically  cumulative hair  thickness \nand hair color , as well as skin pigmentation  explain the variability in several signal quality metrics for fNIRS such as \nScalp Coupling Index and Peak Spectral Power . These insights underscore the interplay between physical attributes \nand data quality, highlighting the necessity for adaptive and inclusive technology in neuroscience research. Our study  \nfurther  emphasizes the importance of consider ing diverse participant profiles in neuroimaging studies, promoting a \nshift towards devices capable of accommodating a wide range of human features. By paving the way for advancements \nin hardware that cater to a diverse population, this work reinforces the  need for equitable representation in \nneuroscience research, ensuring that findings are reflective of and applicable to the broader community.  \nConclusion:  This study demonstrates the significant impact of hair and skin properties on fNIRS signal quality, \nemphasizing the need for inclusive neuroimaging technology.

    "fNIRS Evaluation  of Cortical Reorganization Following \nBrief Speech-in-Noise Training  \n \nZaltz, Yael1,2, Bracha Stav1 \n \n¹Department of Communication Disorders, The Stanley Steyer School of Health Professions, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, \nIsrael; ² Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel    \n  \nPresenting Author: Zaltz Yael;  address: Sokolov 64 street, Ramat Hasharon, Israel;  email: yaelzalt@tauex.tau.ac.il   yaelzaltz@gmail.com ,  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigates cortical effects of single -session speech -in-noise (SIN) training \nusing fNIRS and assesses  data reproducibility. Thirty normal -hearing participants underwent SIN \ntraining with noise -vocoded stimuli. Significant post -training SIN enhancements  were found , \nparticularly  in those with poorer initial performance or lower pre -training activation in the left \nmiddle temporal gyrus (MTG) . MTG activation to trained stimuli decreased post -training, \nsuggesting improved neural processing efficiency . Group -level reliability was confirmed, but \nindividual -level reproducibility of fNIRS data was poor. These findings underscore  the significance \nof fNIRS  in elucidating the mechanisms driving auditory learning and plasticity yet  highlight  the \nchallenges in translating fNIRS data  to clinical practice .    \n \nIntroduction:  While it is widely recognized that even brief training can significantly enhance auditory  performance , \nthere is considerable debate concerning the neural mechanisms responsible for these improvements and their long -\nterm retention. Neurophysiological studies provide valuable insights into early learning stages, and functional near -\ninfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) emerges as a promising ave nue in hearing research due to its noninvasive, quiet, and \nsafe attributes for repeated use, along with its tolerance of movement. The main objectives of this study were twofold: \nfirstly, to explore the cortical effects of single -session auditory training using fNIRS, and secondly, to assess the test -\nretest reliability of the fNIRS data at both the group and individual levels.  \n  \nMethods:  The research comprised thirty young adults aged 19 to 36, all possessing normal hearing. They underwent \nthree sessions spaced 1 -3 days apart. The first session included a hearing test, fNIRS data collection, and a 45 -minute \nsentence -in-noise training, with six adaptive assessments of speech reception thresholds in noise (SRTn). In the second \nsession, two SRTn assessments evaluated the behavioral  impact of training, while fNIRS data assessed its \nphysiological effects. The third session exclusively focused on fNIRS data collection to evaluate test -retest \nreproducibility.  All stimuli for testing and training underwent spectral degradation via an 8 -channel noise vocoder. \nfNIRS data were collected using a pseudorandom block design, alternating among three conditions: speech \nstimulation, speech -shaped noise  stimulation , and speech -in-noise stimulation at a signal -to-noise ratio of +5 dB . \nActivation was assessed via 41 fNIRS channels, positioned over the temporal , pre-frontal , and frontal cortical regions. \nHomer 3 was utilized to extract HBO and HBR beta values from various regions of interest using the general linear \nmodel (GLM). These values were compared across conditions and sessions and correlated with behavioral \nimprovements in SRTn.  \n \nResults: Significant enhancements in SIN perception post -training were evident, especially among individuals with \ninitially poorer SIN performance or lower pre -training activation in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Notably, \nthere was a decrease in left MTG ac tivation to the trained stimuli following training, suggesting potentially more \nefficient neural processing. Given the MTG's involvement in auditory analyses and speech decoding —aiding in \nrecognizing sounds as words and understanding their syntactic proper ties through integration of phonetic and semantic \ncues—the decrease in MTG activation post -training may indicate potential automation of speech decoding processes, \npossibly stemming from improved inhibition of irrelevant noisy information. However, while g roup-level reliability \nwas confirmed, individual -level reproducibility of fNIRS data was poor.  \n  \nConclusion:  The novel findings of this study underscore  the significance of neurophysiological methodologies, \nnotably fNIRS,  in elucidating the mechanisms driving auditory learning and plasticity, offering insights for the \ndevelopment of focused interventions aimed at enhancing auditory abilities . Nevertheless, the individual variability \nobserved in fNIRS data highlight s the difficulties in applying research findings directly  into clinical practice.  46 of 398",

School of Biomedical Engineering, Drexel University, 3141 Chestnut St. , Philadelphia, PA, 19104  USA \nPresenting Author email address: klongardner@health.uscd.edu  \n \nAbstract:  In Parkinson’s disease (PD) orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with cognitive \nimpairment. This study aimed to determine positional differences in cogniti ve performance  and \ncerebral hemodynamics in PD with and without OH , since OH could be a treatable risk factor for \ncognitive dysfunction . Participants with PD with OH (n=4) and without OH (n=8) underwent \nrepeated cognitive testing in supine/sitting and upright positions while wearing a functional near \ninfrared s pectroscopy ( fNIRS ) sensor . The group with OH had low neural efficiency during the \nverbal letter fluency  test while upright, supporting the hypothesis that impaired cerebral \nhemodynamic regulation contributes to cognitive impairment.  \n \nIntroduction:  About one-third of persons with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience neurogenic orthostatic \nhypotension  (OH, i.e., low blood pressure when upright)1, which is associated with short -term and long -term \ncognitive dysfunction , but it remains unknown to what extent OH may contribute to cognitive impairment by  \ncausing  episodic cerebral hypoperfusion2. This  relationship has been  difficult to study  since traditional \nneuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging) cannot assess  participants in the upright \nposition.  Using a portable functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) , this  prospective cross -sectional study \naimed to determine  positional  differences in  cognit ive performance  and cerebral hemodynamics  in PD  groups  with \nand without OH. This is i mportant because OH could be a treatable contributor to  cognitive impairment.  \n \nMethods: We recruited participants with a clinical diagnosis of PD3 without dementia or deep brain stimulation who \nwere not taking antihypertensive medications (UCSD IRB # 210738). Participants were categorized as having OH \n(OH+) or no OH (OH-)4 and underwent a cognitive battery  that was repeated  with alternate versions  in the \nsupine /sitting  and upright positions  while wearing fNIRS  (NIRSport 2, NIRx) .\tWe conducted a preliminary analysis \nof fNIRS data from 12 of these participants (8 OH -, 4 OH +) obtained during the positional cognitive testing. A \nlinear mixed -effects regression model investigated the main and interaction effects of group ( OH- vs. OH+ ) and \nposition (sitting/supine vs. upright) on the dependent variables (cognitive performance, and neural efficiency).  \nNeural efficiency  describes the mental effort (cerebral oxygenation) exerted in relation to cognitive performance.  \n \nResults: During the  Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System  (D-\nKEFS)  letter  verbal  fluency test5, the OH+ group  had low neural \nefficiency (n=4) (M= -0.15, SD= 1 .77), while the  OH- group  had \nhigh efficiency (M= 0.18, SD= 0.97) during the upright position, \nbut the between -group difference was not significant (t(10)= -0.40, \np=.698, 95% CI: ( -2.71, 1.88)). Within the OH+ group, efficiency \nduring the letter fluency test while upright was  low (M= -0.09, SD= \n0. 59) and efficiency was high while sitting/supine (M=0.82, \nD=0.67) (t(11)=2.37, p=0.037, 95% CI:(0.14, 2.07) ( Fig. 1).  \n \nConclusion:  These preliminary results support our hypothesis \nthat persons with PD with OH may have impaired cerebral \nhemodynamic regulation associated with poor cognitive performance.  \n \nReferences:  ( 1 )  Velseboer  et al. , Parkinsonism & related disorders , 2011.

    "Haemodynamic and metabolic functional responses in \npeople with dementia – a functional bNIRS study  \n \nDeepshikha Acharya1, *, Emilia Butters1,2, John O’Brien2, Li Su2,3, Gemma Bale1,4 \n \n1Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK  \n2Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, UK  \n3Institute of Neuroscience, University of Sheffield, UK  \n4Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, UK  \n*da588@cam.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Broadband near -infrared spectroscopy (bNIRS) is a promising tool for at -home  disease \nmonitoring , especially for degenerative neurovascular  pathologies such as dementia . bNIR S can \nestimate both haemodynamic and metabolic changes giving a better understanding of neurovascular \ncoupling than conventional NIRS. Here we show preliminary functional bNIRS results from 3 \nparticipants with varying severity of dementia , highlighting the potential benefit of additional \nmetabolic monitoring  in understanding prodromal cases.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional NIRS  is fast becoming a widely used technique for clinical research  and has potential for  \nat-home monitoring of degenerative diseases such as dementia  [1]. While traditional fNIRS solely studies the \nhaemodynamic response associated with neural activity (neurovascular coupling), dementia could affect both the \nneural and vascular responses of this fundamental neuro -vascular relationship. By u sing a broadband light -source  and \nmonitoring spectral changes , bNIRS can resolve for both changes in haemoglobin  (oxy- and deoxy -haemoglobin)  as \nwell as  metabolism ( cytochrome -c-oxidase), hence providing a better estimate of the changes in neurovascular \ncoupling. Here, we present preliminary results from a functional bNIRS study in a dementia cohort.  \n \nMethods: This work is a part of the collaborative Optical Neuroimaging and Cognition (ONAC) project (IRAS project \nID: 319284) . The recording cohort  (currently, n=42)  comprises people with dementia (Alzheimer’s, Lewy Body), \nMild Cognitive Impairment  (MCI)  and age -matched healthy controls. This analysis  shows results from 3 example \nparticipants with varying severity : healthy control (P1), MCI (P2), and Alzheimer’s (P3).  Functional bNIRS data was \ncollected for a passive visual stimulus  with a recording probe placed over the right occipital cortex (O2)  at a source -\ndetector separation of 3cm  (Fig1 b). bNIRS data was then used to estimate changes in concentration of oxy - (∆HbO), \ndeoxy -haemoglobin (∆Hb R) and oxidation of cytochrome -c-oxidase (∆CCO) in response to a block of stimulus . A \nneuro -psychological evaluation using the Mini Mental -State Examination (MMSE) was done for each participant to \ngauge dementia severity. Additionally, brain atrophy \nwas assessed from subject -specific structural MRIs.  \n \nResults and Conclusion : Evoked haemodynamic \nand metabolic responses varied greatly between the \n3 participants (Fig 1a). Response amplitudes were \npredictably lowest fo r P3 along with the lowest \nMMSE score and largest scalp -to-cortex distance \n(Fig 1c). Conversely, P1 showed some of the highest \nresponse amplitudes, high MMSE score and least \natrophy. However, P2 who was pre -diagnosed with \nMCI, only exhibited a decline in ∆CCO in the bNIRS \ndata, but  with a lower MMSE score and an increased \ncortical distance compared to the healthy control, P1. \nThis might indicate the benefit of bNIRS in using \nmetabolic changes to diagnose prodromal stages of \ndementia . \n \nFuture Work:  We plan to expand our analysis to more participants across all -cohorts . Additionally, to better assess \nchanges in neurovascular coupling, we plan to design a haemo -metabolic transfer function, relating the changes in \n∆HbO to ∆CCO. Finally, we hope to better understand and tackle the limitations of NIRS in studying subjects with \nbrain atrophy. Utilising clinical structural MRI and Monte -Carlo simulations we plan to  estimate the cortical \nsensitivity of bNIRS for each participant  and incorporate that in partial volume estimates.  \n \nReference:  \n1.

    "The association between caregiver inhibitory control, \ncaregiving behaviours, and infant visual cognition.  \n \nChristina Davidsona & Sobanawartiny Wijeakumara \n \na. School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, NG7 2RD, Nottingham, England, U.K. ),  \nPresenting Author email address: Christina.Davidson@nottingham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigated whether caregiver inhibitory control was associated with infant \nvisual cognition  and whether caregiver behavio urs during dyadic interactions could explain th is \nassociation.  Caregiver inhibitory control was assessed using a Go -NoGo task and infant visual \ncognition was assessed using a preferential looking task.  Caregiver behavio urs were coded from \nnaturalistic play interactions.  Better caregiver inhibit ory control  was associated with lesser left \nmiddle frontal gyrus (lMFG) activation in infants. While caregiver behavio urs did not mediate this \nassociation, better caregiver scaffolding was negatively  associated with lesser infant lMFG \nactivation , suggesting that supportive  caregiving  might directly impact attentional control networks \nin infants.  \n \nIntroduction:  Caregivers play a significant role in shaping children’s early cognitive development. Previous work \nhas shown that caregiver executive functions (EF) can predict child cognitive development at 24 months. Similarly, \nboth caregiver EFs and caregiver behavio urs during dyadic interactions account for unique variance in child cognitive \nfunctions at 36 months.  We build upon this work by first examining whether caregiver inhibitory control was \nassociated with infant visual cognition , and second,  whether caregiver behavio urs during dyadic interactions could \nmediate these  associations . \n \nMethods: 91 caregivers (33. 5 ± 4.5 years) and 91 infants (25 1.3 ± 34.9 days)  participated in the study. To assess \ninhibitory control, the caregivers completed a Go -NoGo task. Here, c aregivers had to either elicit  (Go) or inhibit  \n(NoGo)  a response for four separate stimuli. An efficiency score was calculated for each caregiver by dividing average \nreaction time by  correct response rate to provide an index of processing efficiency.  To assess visual cognition, infants \nwere presented with a preferential looking task. In this task, two side -by-side displays of coloured  shapes flashed on \nand off. On the ‘unchanging’ side, the colours were always the same and on the ‘changing’ side, a random shape \nchanged colour after each flash. V isual working memory  load was manipulated by presenting 1 (low), 2 (medium) or \n3 (high) items. Change preference (CP) score was calculated as the amount of time spent looking to the changing side \ndivided by the total time spent looking at both sides . Functional near -infrared spectroscopy was used to record brain \nactivation  from infants . In additi on, c aregivers were asked to engage their infants with toys during simple (indepen dent \ntoys such as car, rattle, butterfly etc.) and complex  (sorting and stacking toys) play interactions that lasted between 5 \nand 7 minutes. From these interactions, caregiver behavio urs i.e.  intrusiveness and scaffolding , were  manually coded \nby experimenters . \n \nResults: Our findings revealed that there was no direct association between caregiver efficiency and infant CP score. \nInstead, we found an indirect association - caregiver efficiency was linked to infant CP score through left -lateralized \nfronto -parietal engagement.  Of importance , better caregiver efficiency was associated with decreased activation  of \nleft middle frontal gyrus (lMFG) in infants , a region  involved in attentional control and distractor suppression.  \nMediation analyses revealed that neither caregiver intrusiveness nor scaffolding could explain this association. \nHowever, we found associations between caregiver behavio urs during dyadic interactions and infant lMFG \nengagement  in the visual cognition task . First, we found that caregiver intrusiveness during simple play interactions \nwas positively correlated with lMFG, such that greater intrusiveness was linked to increased activation. Second, we \nfound that caregiver scaffolding during complex play interactions was negatively correlated with lMFG, such that \ngreater scaffolding was linked to decreased activation.  \n \nConclusion:  Our results suggest that reduced intrusiveness and better scaffolding caregiver behavio urs might play an \nimportant role in shaping attentional control networks in the infant brain. These findings contribute to a growing body \nof literature examining the role that caregivers play in early neurocognitive development.  49 of 398",
    "Somatotopic organization of the thumb and shoulder Nogier \npoints in the primary somatosensory cortex using HD-fNIRS \n \nErnest Okorie1, Hendrik Santosa2, Theodore Huppert1, Benedict Alter3, Keith Vogt3 \n \n1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.  \n2Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.  \n3Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA . \neco17@pitt.edu  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigated the somatotopic representation of thumb and shoulder Nogier \npoints in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) using high density functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy in 17 healthy adults. Tactile stimulation at these points revealed distinct lateral (thumb) \nand medial (shoulder) activations, with ipsilateral dominance for the thumb and contralateral for the \nshoulder. A positive cor relation was found between  reported  stimulation pain and brain activity. \nMild pain and pressure sensations were reported, confirming the somatotopic organization of ear \npoints in S1, which has implications for understanding sensory mapping and its clinical and \ntherapeutic applications.  \n \nIntroduction:  Neuroscience has explored how the S1 maps body parts along specific directions. Recent research hints \nat a similar mapping in ear points, known as Nogier points, but findings on their brain activations are inconsistent. \nOur study investigates the somatotop ic representation in S1 of two Nogier points linked to the thumb and shoulder. \nWe anticipate distinct lateral and medial activations for these points, respectively. This research aims to clarify the \near's somatotopic organization in S1 and it s activation patterns, enhancing our understanding of sensory mapping in \nthe brain with implications for clinical and therapeutic practices.  \n \nMethods: Our study enrolled 17 healthy adults (14 males, three females, average age 23.3) to examine cortical \nresponses using fNIRS during tactile stimulation at Nogier points (thumb, shoulder, skin master) with 26g von Frey \nfilaments. Participants rated their pain  and pressure sensations on a 0 -10 scale. The 2 -hour sessions involved \ncontralateral and ipsilateral stimulation. fNIRS data from the somatosensory cortex were analyzed for hemoglobin \nchanges using MATLAB and AnalyzIR Toolbox. The high -density NIR Scout -2 system (21 0 channels) facilitated \naccurate cortical mapping. Ethical standards were maintained, with approval from the University of Pittsburgh’s \ninstitutional review board.  \n \nResults: The study revealed that tactile stimulation at the thumb and shoulder points on the ear leads to distinct \nactivations in the primary somatosensory cortex: lateral for the thumb and medial for the shoulder, with ipsilateral \ndominance for the thumb and contr alateral for the shoulder. A positive correlation was observed between stimulation \npressure and brain  activation. Participants reported mild pain and pressure sensations, averaging around three on a \nten-point scale.  \n \nConclusion:  Our study explored the somatotopic representation in the primary somatosensory cortex of two specific \nNogier points, the thumb and shoulder, using high -density functional near -infrared spectroscop y. Involving 17 \nparticipants, we assessed the cortical response to \ntactile stimulation at these points, expecting \nlateral activation for the thumb and medial for the \nshoulder. Results confirmed distinct activation \npatterns for each point, with ipsilateral dominance \nfor the thumb and contralateral for the shoulder \nand a positive correlation between applied \npressure and brain activity. Pain and pressure \nlevels were reported, providing insights into the \near's somatotopic organization and potential \nclinical and therapeutic implications.   \nFigure: Contralateral Thumb -Shoulder Contrast and the \nSource -Detector Layout  \n50 of 398",

We \nfound group  differences in brain response to live language and recorded language , as well a s \nassociations between children ’s brain response and their language skills . Findings may help to \nexplain why ASD children experience challenges using and understanding language . \n \nIntroduction:  To  date, no studies have investigated  how the brains of preschool -aged children process l anguage \nduring li ve social interactions , despite this being a sensitive period in language development . The present study \nexamined the neural bases of live language processing in 20 neurotypical (NT)  and 20 autistic (ASD)  preschool- aged \nchildren . fNIRS was used to measure children’s brain response during a live language condition (listened to story read \nby live experimenter) and a recorded language condition (listened to story played via audio recording) . The study a ims \nwere to 1) compare the strength of brain response between conditions within groups , 2) compare strength of brain \nresponse during each condition  between groups , and 3) explore the associations between brain response and children ’s \nlanguage  skills within groups .  \n \nMethods: The sample included N=20 NT children ( 15 M, 5 F) and N=20 ASD  children (17 M, 3 F), 3 to 6 years old . \nA TechEn CW 7 fNIRS system (50 Hz,  690nm and 830nm) was used to measure children’s brain function during two \nconditions – a live language condition and a recorded language condition . During the live language condition, children \nlistened to a story read by a live experimenter . During the recorded language condition, children listened to a different \nstory played via an audio recording . Stories were divided into 18 t rials (10 seconds long), and a jittered fixation cross \nwas presented in between trials (10 to 15 seconds  long) . The fNIRS cap bilaterally covered the inferior and middle \nfrontal gyrus (IMFG), the superior and middle temporal gyrus (SMTG), and the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) . Data \nwere  processed in  Homer3 using standard procedures  (Yü cel et al ., 2021) , including  channel pruning, spline SG \nmotion artifact correction  (Jahani et al ., 2018), low pass filtering, global signal regression, and GLM HRF estimation \n(Huppert, 2016) . Average HbO concentration values from 0 to 10 seconds (trial length) were used for within -group \nand between -group analyses . Children’s language skills were also measured using a standardized behavioral \nassessment (Preschool Language Scales ; Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2011) . \n \nResults: Within  the NT group, HbO  was greater during the live language  \ncondition than the recorded language  condition in the right TPJ (t=3.085, \np=.007) . Within  the ASD group, the strength of brain response did not \nsignificantly differ between conditions  (ps≥.093) . The ASD group showed \ngreater brain response than the NT group during the recorded language  \ncondition in the right IMFG  (t=2.495, p=.017) . Language  skills  were positively \ncorrelated with brain response during the recorded language condition in the \nleft SMTG for the NT group ( r=.645, p=.007) and the left IMFG for the ASD \ngroup ( r=.624, p=.007) .  \n \nConclusion:  Condition differences in the strength of  right TPJ brain response  suggest that NT children, but not ASD  \nchildren , were engaged in social cognitive processes (e.g., joint attention, mentalizing)  during the live language \ncondition (Mundy, 2018 ; Krall et al ., 2015) . Group differences in the strength of right IMFG brain response align  with \nprevious findings of right hemisphere dominance during language processing in ASD  (Herringshaw et al ., 2016 ). \nReduced left -lateralized brain response to language may help to explain why some ASD children experience  \nchallenges using and understanding language . \nAverage HbO concentration values during live language condition and recorded language condition in all ROIs by group \n51 of 398",

Results indicated \nsimilar chromophore concentration changes and area under curve metrics across all light \nsources. The findings suggest that LEDs can replace halogen sources in bNIRS applications.  \n \nIntroduction:  Despite the well -established status of tungsten halogen sources as the gold standard in providing \nillumination for bNIRS , their cost, size, and energy consumption drive the search for alternative light sources. \nLEDs, known for their efficiency, longevity, as well as lower costs and size, have emerged as potential candidates.  \n \nMethods: The comparative analysis utilizes near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for conducting arm occlusion \ntests. The experimental setup entails affixing three light sources in turn onto to an adult subject's forearm, the light \nsources used include two LEDs (OSRAM, SYNIOS) and a tungsten halogen light source (Ocean Optics) via \noptical fibres. Integration times of 0.4, 0.4 and 0.2 s were used for each light source respectively. Moreover, e ach \nlight source incorporates an optical low -pass filter set at 630 nm to reduce the range of spectral range input into \nthe subject's forearm. A spectrometer (Wasatch), positioned 2 cm away from the light source via optical fiber, \ncompletes the setup. To ensure stability and minimize ambient light interference, both the light  source and \nspectrometer are enveloped in elastic cohesive bandages. Baseline concentrations are established within a 60 -\nsecond interval. Subsequently, the cuff is inflated to initiate arterial occlusion, maintained for 60 seconds, followed \nby deflation to  facilitate reperfusion, allowing a further 30 seconds for measurements to return to baseline levels.  \nQuantitative measurements were complemented by statistical analysis and visual assessments to ensure a \ncomprehensive evaluation.  \n \nResults: Figure 1 shows intensity spectra for each device. The concentration changes  results show  a promising \nconsistency in the temporal dynamics, as reflected in similar area under curve ( AUC ) metrics for haemoglobin \noxygenation (HbO2) and deoxygenation (HHb) as well as oxidised cytochrome -c-oxidase (oxCCO) cross all \nsources . Expressed in M ·s the HbO2 AUC values were 0.182, 0.129 and 0.209, HHb AUC was 0.141, 0.190, and \n0.198  , oxCCO AUC values \nwere 0.009127, 0.038706, \nand 0.01591 for the TH, \nSYNIOS LED and OSRAM \nLED respectively.  \n \nConclusion:  These findings \nsubstantiate the potential of \nLEDs to serve as effective \nsubstitutes for halogen \nsources, the LEDs not only \nmatch the performance of the \nhalogen sources in all tested \naspects but also offer \nadditional benefits, including \nreduced power consumption , \nexpense,  and size. This \nfinding opens the door to \nfurther investigations into \nwearable  bNIRS devices .

In a \nquasi -naturalistic setting, in forty -six participants prefrontal brai n activity during self -touch and \nsocial -touch was examined with fNIRS.  Brain oxygenation in the PFC was significantly increased \nduring self -touch compared to social -touch, while social -touch as compared to self -touch led to a \nsignificantly higher brain deoxygenation . \n \nIntroduction:  Touch and its neuropsychological correlates have so far been largely based on structured and therefore \nunnatural touch behavior . Therefore, no reliable conclusions can be drawn for everyday life and the differences and \nsimilarities between self -touch and other -touch behavior . The commonalties and difference between naturalistic \nsocial -touch and self -touch is particularly relevant in times of deprivation of social -touch because self -touch could \npotentially compensate for the negative effects of experiencing deprivation of soci al touch, such as during corona \npandemic.  For this reason, th e aim of this  study is to investigates the eff ects of self -touch on cortical brain activity \ncompared to social -touch under more naturalistic conditions . \n \nMethods:  In a quasi -naturalistic setting, in forty -six participants (19 - 39 years  ;31 female, 15 male ) brain activity in \nthe frontopolar areas, d orsolateral prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) during self -touch and \nsocial -touch was recorded using 8x8 fNIRS device .  In a natural context, different subtypes of self -touch and social -\ntouch are displayed such as phasic, repetitive, and irregular touches The self -touch is performed in three blocks six \ntimes with the dominant hand and six times with the non -dominant hand on the upper side of the other forearm for \nnine seconds. The touch should be carried out in a subjectively p leasant manner. The same touches are then carried \nout by the experimenter on the test subjects as external touches.  fNIRS data analysis was performed using the Satori \n(v.2.0) toolbox and s tatistical analysis was conducted using RStudio . \n \nResults: Our results showed that there are differences in the brain activity between pleasant self -touch and pleasant \nsocial -touch.  Social -touch, as compared to self -touch, significantly deactivated the left and right medial frontopolar \nareas and parts of the left OFC as well as parts of the left and right lateral dlPFC. Among these channels, in the channel \nwith the highest specifity for the left dLPFC the deactivation was significantly lower than in the other  channels. In \ncontrast self -touch, as compared to social -touch activated significantly more strongly all  channels in the left and right \nfrontopolar areas, dlPFC and OFC.  \n \nConclusion:   \nDue to the cerebral activation and deactivation patterns our results indicate that self -touch cannot replace social -touch \nregarding the positive effects such as being hedonistic in the moment, but it is important for self -regulating \nmechanisms such as distancing from constraints by using internally focused processes like “mind -wandering”.  We \ntherefore conclude that a more holistic and natural aspect of touching behavior should be considered in touching \nresearch. Also, additional data of the somatosensory cortex, physiological data such as respiration measurements or \nheart rate variability , measuring hormones and a questionnaire about thoughts during the intervention could lead to \nmore precise insights.  \n  \n 53 of 398",
    "Two-phase auditory evoked fNIRS responses in sleeping \ninfants  \nDemi Gao1,2, Julia Wunderlich1,2, Linty McDonald1, Suwana Watt1, Gautam \nBalasubramanian1, Onn Wah Lee1, Darren Mao1,2, Colette McKay1,2 \n \n1 Bionics Institute; East Melbourne, VIC 3002, Australia.  \n2 Department of Medical Bionics, University of Melbourne; Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.  \ndgao@bionicsinstitute.org  \n \nAbstract:  Our research revealed a consistent two -phased fNIRS response indicative of changes in \noxygenated blood concentration when infants are exposed to brief, repeated speech segments while \nasleep . We proposed a method to extract the independent components in the fNIRS responses based \non Independent Component Analysis . We hypothesi se that two extracted independent components \nconsist of a positive component and a negative component. The extracted components are valuable \nfeatures that can be used for objectively assessing hearing levels in sleeping infants.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a developing technology that uses near -infrared light \nto image brain activity in the surface layers of the cortex. It measures changes in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) and \ndeoxyhaemoglobin (HbR) in response to stimul i. Th is haemodynamic response can measure the brain’s response to \ndistinguishing between different acoustic signal s and can measure hearing ability in auditory neuropathy. The features \nof fNIRS make it suitable for objectively assessing hearing levels by examining the morphology of sound -evoked \nfNIRS response.  \n \nMethods: Seven  sleeping infants with no known hearing loss participated in the study. A natural ly prod uced  speech \ntoken  /ba/ was recorded,  trimmed and concatenated into a 5.4 s stimulus block. The stimulus was presented monaurally \nbetween 45 to 90 dB SPL using an insert earphone . fNIRS responses were recorded from bilateral pre -frontal and \ntemporal regions.  fNIRS data were analysed using the MNE -Python and custom script . Data were converted to optical \ndensity and haemoglobin change.  Motion artefacts were corrected using the Temporal Derivative Distribution Repair \n(TDDR ) function.  The data were band pass filtered between 0.01 – 0.25 Hz.  Channels with scalp coupling index  \nthreshold <0.8 were discarded.  The data were epoched between -3 s and 27 s from stimulus onset, and baseline \ncorrected to the average of –3 to 0 s.  \n \nResults: We observed a positive peak at around 5 – 6 s from \nstimulus onset and followed by a negative trough at around 10 – \n20 s from stimulus onset. The amplitudes and latencies of this \nresponse varied with different stimulus intensity levels  (Fig. 1 \nLeft). To better understand how the independent neural responses \nare associated with auditory processing in sleeping infants, we \nconducted Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on the data  \nacross all sound levels . The results showed that two ICA \ncomponents with the highest signal power consist of a positive \ncomponent and a negative component  (Fig. 1 Right) . Our ICA \nresult confirmed our hypothesis that there are two independent \nresponse mechanisms that contribute  to the auditory evoked \nfNIRS response  in sleeping infant. The peak amplitudes of the \nreconstructed components systematically change with the \nintensity of stimulus . \n \nConclusion:  Our findings suggest the importance of multiple independent response mechanisms in the analysis of \nsleeping infant fNIRS responses to speech sounds. The extracted features  of the fNIRS  response will facilitate the \nassessment of hearing levels in this population.  \n \n  \nFigure 1: Loudness modulated auditory evoked \nfNIRS responses  (HbO) .

We investigated the effects of MT on blood flow in the \nlower leg using diffus e correlation spectroscopy  in 27 healthy adults. The results showed a \nsignificant increase in the muscle and skin b lood flow and tissue temperature  after MT , supporting \nthe use of MT to promote  local tissue perfusion.  \n \nIntroduction:  Manual therapy (MT) applies manual techniques such as  rubbing, pressing , and kneading  to the \nmusculo skeletal system  for injury prevention, treatment , and relaxation  purposes . To further underst and its \nphysiological effect , we investigated the MT-related peripheral tissue blood flow and temperature response s. \n \nMethods: We enroll ed 27 healthy young adults ( 13 males  and 14 females ) ranging in age from 20 to 2 2 years  without \nleg injurie s. Following a 2 -minute rest period (pre -MT), we administered MT to the right medial gastrocnemius \nmuscle for 5 minutes, followed by a 20 -minute rest period (post -MT). Throughout the experiment, we continuously \nmonitored muscle blood flow  (blood flow index: BFI) , skin blood flow (SBF), and surface and deep tissue \ntemperature s of the lower leg using diffuse correlation spectroscopy  (DCS ) [1], laser Doppler flowmetry, and skin \nand tissue thermometer s, respectively. Median values of these biological parameters between pre - and post -MT \nperiods were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank t est.  \n \nResults: BFI and SBF on the treated side  (MT side ) increased  significantly  by 1.33 and 1. 19-fold, respectively,  in \nthe post-MT period  compared to  the pre-MT period (Figure 1) . These effects lasted for at least 20 min utes. BFI on \nthe non-treated  side (CT side)  also increased significantly to approximately 1.1 2-fold. On the MT side, surface  tissue  \ntemperature  increased  significantly  from 29.1 to 29.9°C and the deep tissue temperature increased significantly  from \n34.0 to 34.9°C. On the CT side, the surface  tissue  temperature increased  significantly  from 29.1 to 29.9°C and the \ndeep tissue temperature also increased from 34.3 to 34.9°C.   \n \nConclusion:  We found that 5  minutes of  MT significantly increased skin and muscle blood flow and temperature  at \nthe treatment site , and these increases persisted 20  minutes after MT.  Our previous stud y [2, 3] also demonstrated \nthe blood flow -promoting effect of MT  in the upper trapezius muscl e, suggesting the versatility of MT regard less of \nthe application  site. Although the current results are insufficient to provide the physiological mechanism, an \nintriguing result was found on the CT side. Muscle blood flow and  temperature  of the CT side  increased significantly \nafter MT  as well  without any  direct  physical  intervention.  \n \nReference:  \n[1] Nakabayashi , M. et al.

    "Evaluating Cortical Activity and Balance Performance in \nAlpine Skiers  \nHaroon Khana, Paolo Victor Redondoc, Håvard Engellb, Hernando Ombaoc and Peyman \nMirtaheria \na Department of MEK, OsloMet - Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway  \nb GAITLINE AS, Oslo, Norway  \nc Statistic Program, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  \nPresenting Author email address: haroonkh@oslomet.no  \n \nAbstract:  The study evaluates the balance performance of young skiers using single -leg stance \n(SLS) and dual -leg stance (DLS) by measuring cortical activation using fNIRS and modified hope \nbalance test (MHBT). A statistical framework Functional mix effect model was used to model the \ndifference between right -leg stance (RLS), left -leg stance (LLS), and DLS. The results show a \nsignificant difference (P<0.0001) in motor cortex hemodynamics during SLS and DLS while no \nsignificant difference was found during RLS and LLS. The study also contrasts Broca regions' \nresponses to various tasks . These findings contribute to understanding the neural mechanisms \ngoverning balance control in skiers.  \n \nIntroduction:  The study identifies an association between brain functional response (cortical hemodynamic \nactivation) and balance performance in a group of young skiers during both single -leg stance (SLS) and dual -leg stance \n(DLS) utilizing functional near -infrared spec troscopy (fNIRS) alongside the modified hop balance test (MHBT).  \n \nMethods: N=9 young skier underwent two balance experiments to assess and compare their dynamic balance \nperformance. The first experiment, termed SLS and DLS with fNIRS, aimed to ascertain cortical activity linked to \npostural balance control for each leg, identifyin g cortical activation areas and assessing lateralization's role in control. \nSubsequently, participants completed the MHBT after a substantial rest period to obtain a functional and quantitative \nassessment for each leg. The MHBT comprised forward a nd sidewise hops with one or both eyes closed on a \nchallenging surface. The experimental paradigm included three tasks: Right -leg stance (RLS), Dual -leg stance (DLS), \nand Left -leg stance (LLS), repeated sequentially. Differences in the hemodynamic response  across experimental \nconditions were formally tested under the statistical framework called the functional mixed effects model. This model \nsimultaneously captures common patterns across subjects and accounts for variations in brain functional responses \nacross subjects.  \nResults: Results unveiled a notable contrast (p<0.0001) in cortical activation between SLS and DLS with higher \ncortical activation during SLS, suggesting distinct neural control mechanisms for single -leg and dual -leg balance. No \nsignificant differences were found i n cortical activation and balance performance when comparing the Left -leg stance \n(LLS) and Right -leg stance (RLS). Moreover, skiers exhibited superior balance during lateral hops compared to \nforward hops in the MHBT. Intriguingly, discernible cort ical activation patterns were observed during SLS and DLS, \ninvolving various brain regions including the primary motor cortex (PMC), pre -motor area (PMA), supplementary \nmotor cortex (SMC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPFC), Wernicke's area (WA), primar y somatosensory cortex, \njuxtaposed with Broca's area (BA), subcentral gyrus, retrosubicular area, and temporal gyrus (TG). Further studies are \nrequired to fully understand the functional implications of these activation patterns.  \n \nConclusion:  Statistically significant cortical activation was observed in the SLS compared to the DLS. However, no \nsignificant differences were noted between LLS and RLS. This observation suggests that participants being \nextensively trained maintain balance equally well on both legs which stimulates the motor cortex equally across b oth \nhemispheres. Future studies comparing skiers with the general non -skier population experiencing balance difficulties \nmight exhibit discrepancies in association brain function between LLS and RLS. These findings contribute to \nunderstanding the neural me chanisms governing balance control in skiers and suggest potential avenues for targeted \ninterventions aimed at enhancing balance performance.   \n \n56 of 398",
    "Comparison of Photogrammetry and 3D Scanning Methods  \nto Traditional Digitizer for Localization of fNIRS Channels \nTatsuya Suzuki1, Yumie Ono2\n1Electrical Engineering Program, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan \n2Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan \nPresenting Author email address: tatsuya@meiji.ac.jp  \nAbstract:  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) requires an accurate spatial localization \nof fNIRS channel. We investigated the agreement between the fNIRS channel localization methods \nof photogrammetry and 3D scanning compared to the conventional digitizer. MNI coordinates of \nsimulated fNIRS channels covering the whole head were determined using all three methods. The \nEuclidian distance between digitizer and photogrammetry, as well as 3D scan, were negligible \n(median error = 6.96 and 7.07 mm, respectively), demonstrating the utility of photogrammetry as a \nlow-cost and easy-to-use head digitization method, as well as 3D scan method. \nIntroduction:  Accurate localization of individual channels in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is crucial \nfor precise evaluation of cortical activation. Recently, photogrammetry and 3D scanning have emerged as low-cost \nalternatives to traditional electromagnetic digitizer for obtaining 3D coordinates of optode positions (Homölle et al., \n2019; Mazzonetto et al., 2022). In our pursuit of a cost-effective and widely accessible localization method without \nmanual pointing using electromagnetic digitizer, we propose smartphone-driven photogrammetry. This study aims to \nassess the agreement between fNIRS channel coordinates obtained through photogrammetry and structured-light 3D \nscanning methods compared to the established gold standard of electromagnetic digitizer technique. \nMethods: Twenty-one adult participants underwent the fitting of an optode cap and marking of fiducial points (nasion, \ninion, preauricular points, and Cz). We generated 3D models of each participant’s head using photogrammetry via an \niPhone and 3D scanning with an iPad equipped with Structure Sensor ST01 (Occipital). Photogrammetry and 3D scan \nwere conducted by walking around the participant using iOS apps of \n“Scaniverse” and “itSeez3D”, respectively. Subsequently, the 3D \ncoordinates of fiducial points and optode positions (32 sources and \n38 detectors) were determined from each 3D head model using \nMeshLab, an open-source software. Electromagnetic digitization \nusing FASTRAK (Polhemus) was also performed to acquire 3D \ncoordinates. The coordinates were then converted to MNI \ncoordinates of 104 fNIRS channels using NIRS-SPM software (Ye \net al., 2009). We computed the Euclidian distance of MNI \ncoordinates between digitizer and photogrammetry, as well as 3D \nscan, for all channels across all participants. \nResults: The median distance errors of the detected fNIRS channel \npositions relative to the digitizer-based coordinates were 6.96 and \n7.07 mm in photogrammetry (a) and 3D scanning (b) methods, \nrespectively (Figure 1). The spatial accuracy distribution of fNIRS \nchannel positions averaged over participants (Figure 2) \ndemonstrated generally negligible errors in localizing fNIRS \nchannels, with slightly increased error in the posterior part of the \nhead in both methods. \nConclusion:  Our findings reveal that photogrammetry as well as 3D \nscanning demonstrated comparable correspondence with the \ndigitizer. Photogrammetry and 3D scanning would be options for \ncost-effective and user-friendly fNIRS channel localization method \nalthough these methods require more extensive post-processing to \nobtain 3D coordinates of fNIRS optode positions compared to the \nelectromagnetic digitizer. Particularly, photogrammetry, requiring \nonly a conventional camera device capable of taking photos, \npresents a promising alternative to digitizer or 3D scanner.

    "Development of a wavelength modulated near-infrared \nspectroscopy system \n \nDanica M. Pacis, Adam P. Gibson, Jeremy C. Hebden   \n \nUniversity College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering , London, WC1E 6BT, UK   \ndanica.pacis.19@ucl.ac.uk   \n \nAbstract:  Near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a widely used diagnostic  tool because of its \nsensitivity to changes in blood volume and oxygenation in tissue. However, NIRS is also highly \nsensitive to variable coupling between the optical probe and  the skin surface.  An experimental \nsystem is being developed which employs a wavelength -modulated source to perform NIRS \nmeasurements that are potentially insensitive to surface coupling and may enable measurements of \nabsolute concentrations of tissue chromophores . The ability of the system,  based on a \nsupercontinuum laser an acousto -optic tun able filter , to quantify the concentrations of absorbers in \nturbid media is being evaluated with promising results.  \n \nIntroduction:  Near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a diagnostic tool which usually involves estimating changes in \nthe concentrations of oxy - and deoxy -hemoglobin in biological tissue from measurements of changes in the diffuse \nreflectance of near -infrared light. While NIRS  measurements can be used  to generate  dynamic  images and monitor \nbrain activation, they are highly sensitive to changes in surface coupling. Surface coupling can vary due to hair, skin \ncolor and texture, and changes during relative motion of the probe . Uncertain coupling and losses due to scattering \nrender absolute concentrations of chromophores in tissue very difficult to quantify , and NIRS methods commonly  \nmeasur e differences between two signals  assum ing these factors remain constant.  Recent paper s [1,2] explore an \nalternative approach  known as wavelength -modulated NIRS  (WM -NIRS) , where the source wavelength is modulated \nat a fixed frequency. The theory suggests that if the ratio between the variation in the measured intensity over a small \nwavelength range and the average measured intensity is independent of coupling, then measurements may enable the \nderivation of the absolute values of chromophore concentrations  [1]. \n \nMethods: The WM -NIRS  approach  is investigated experimentally using a supercontinuum laser and an acousto -optic \ntunable filter  (AOTF) to generate the wavelength -modulated source . The system shown in Fig . 1 modulates both the \nwavelength and the intensity of the beam  at different frequencies , and  the modulation in detected intensity  due to both \nis measured using lock -in amplifier s. The ratio of modulation amplitudes is proportional to the first derivative of the \nsample absorption coefficient [1]. After compensation for the wavelength dependence of specific system components, \nthe ratio can be used to characterize  tissue -like samples containing wavelength -dependent absorbers.  \n \nResults: Initial experiments confirm that the measured \nmodulation amplitude ratio is independent of absolute \nintensity (i.e. of coupling ) and  has been used to \ncharacterize the absolute absorbing properties of sample \nmedia.  \n \nConclusion:  The WM-NIRS system can successfully \nmeasure the first derivative of the absorption spectra of \nsamples . This means that if the optical pathlength in the \nsample is known or can be reliably estimated, we can \nderive absolute measurements of absorber \nconcentration, opening up the possibility of using NIRS \nto investigate static physiology such as stroke or \nhemorrhage . \n \nReferences  \n[1] Hebden, J.C.

The number of measurement wavelengths was varied from 5 -200, and uncertainties in the differential \npathlength factor (DPF) and extinction coefficients of up to 10% were introduced to determine their effect on \nNIRS -derived conc entration changes. Deviations from the true concentration values were found to be below 10% \nin ideal conditions. However, when parameter errors are increased to more realistic values, CCO errors are \nhighly wavelength dependent and orders of magnitude large r. \n \nBackground  \nThe oxidation state of cytochrome -c-oxidase (oxCCO) indicates cellular energy usage efficiency and \nmetabolism, potentially serving as a biomarker for brain disorders. Different NIRS systems have different \nbandwidth or numbers of wavelengths,  and the effect of this on derived changes in oxCCO are unknown.  In -\ndepth investigation of the errors associated with these measurements would allow elevated confidence in results \nand could aid in NIRS being more widely adopted for these purposes.  \nMethods  \nA diffusion -based model [1] was employed to investigate the theoretical capability of NIRS systems to measure \nchanges in the oxidation state of cerebral oxCCO alongside oxy - and deoxy -haemoglobin (HbO and HbR). The \neffect of number of wavelengths, wavelen gth combination, source bandwidth and uncertainties in DPF and \nextinction coefficient on the calculated concentration change were investigated.  \nResults  \nFor systems with small numbers of wavelengths, the errors in chromophore concentration changes can be ve ry \nlarge. The magnitude of the error depends on the number of wavelengths, the bandwidth of the sources and the \nuncertainty in DPF and extinction coefficient values used. As can be seen in Figure 1, if the number of \nwavelengths used is less than 50 and the  error in the DPF and extinction coefficients used is just 10%, the \nexpected error in chromophore concentration change can be greater than 100%.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion  \nThe accuracy of derived chromophore concentration changes is highly dependent on choice of system \nwavelengths and uncertainties in DPF and extinction coefficients. Due to factors  such as low oxCCO \nconcentration in vivo, it is highly unlikely that systems with a small number of discrete measurement \nwavelengths will have low enough errors to estimate small changes in oxCCO. Assessment of the likely \nmeasurement errors is advisable to  increase the certainty of oxCCO observations in human studies.   59 of 398",

Therefore, the aim of this study is to inspect the effect of feedback on risky decision-\nmaking and its neural correlates in individuals with IGD as compared to those from the healthy controls (HCs). \nMethods: Forty-two right-handed participants, including 15 with IGD and 27 HCs, underwent a sequential risk-taking task. \nBehavioral modeling was used to measure risky propensity, behavioral consistency, and emotional affection from the \nprevious trial. Concurrent electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) recordings were \nperformed to demonstrate when, where and how the previous-round feedback affects the decision making to the next round. \nResults: We discovered that both IGD and HC groups exhibited higher risky propensity after the loss feedback as \ncompared to those from the win one ( p = 0.03). In addition, the IGD group illustrated heightened risk-taking \npropensity as compared to the HC group, indicating by the computational modeling ( p = 0.028). EEG results also showed \nsignificant time window differences in univariate and multivariate pattern analysis between the IGD and HC groups after the \nloss of the game. Further, reduced brain activation in the prefrontal cortex during the task was detected in IGD group as compared \nto that of the control group. \nConclusions: Risky decision-making in IGD group might be due to the complex interplay between emotional \nresponse and other cognitive factors. The pilot study paved a new avenue for fully understanding of the aberrant decision-making \nprocesses in IGD, offering guides for future interventions and treatments of various categories of behavioral addictions. \nFig. 1.

At \nthe individual level, we demonstrate that fNIRS can detect commonly studied resting state networks, \nsensorimotor processing, speech  perception , and command -driven brain activity. Testing fNIRS \nwith three acutely unresponsive patients , we found that one  could willfully modulate their brain \nactivity  – providing evidence of preserved consciousness despite no observable behavioural signs \nof awareness. Th ese promising res ults highlight the potential of fNIRS as a tool for uncovering \nhidden cognitive states in critical care settings.  \n \nIntroduction:  Recent advancements in functional neuroimaging have demonstrated that some unresponsive \npatients in the intensive care unit (ICU) retain a level of consciousness that is inconsistent with their behavioural \ndiagnosis of awareness. However, current neuroimaging methods – such as fMRI and EEG – are often impractical to \nuse with this population of patients. fNIRS is a promising alternative ; however, its sensitivity  for detecting the neural \ncorrelates of consciousness remains to be established.  In this series of  studies,  we explore whether fNIRS can reliably \nidentify neural correlates of consciousness processing  in healthy participants at the individual -participant level using \na sequence  of validated fMRI paradigms . We then use these methods to assess brain activity in acutely unresponsive \npatients in the ICU.   \n Methods: A well -established hierarchical paradigm was used to assess basic sensory and higher -level brain \nfunction. Specifically, we evaluated neural activity at rest to assess resting -state connectivity, during passive stimulus -\nbased paradigm s assessing sensorimotor processing  (median nerve stimulation) and speech  perceptio n (pseudo -words  \nand short stories), and during two active tasks (motor imagery and spatial navigation).  A total of 118 datasets were \ncollected from healthy participants across all tasks (age range 20 -48, 62 datasets from females ). Three  acutely \nunresponsive patients with severe brain injury were also  recruited from the  ICU and assessed with the same tasks. \nResting state data was collected for six minutes while task -based paradigms were conducted in a block design with \nalternating 30 -s cycles of task and rest for a total experiment time ranging from five to fifteen minutes depending on \nthe task. A n fNIRS system with 32 sources and 32 detectors  (NIRScoutXP , NIRx Medical Technologies, LLC) was \nused with 121 long channels and 8 short channels, providing coverage of the frontal, parietal and temporal regions. \nThe data was corrected for motion artifacts, band -pass filtered , and short channels were regressed in the GLM \nframework to reduce the effects of systemic physiological noise . For resting state, the time series were pre -whitened \nand seed -based analysis was used to extract resting state networks. For task -based paradigms, single -level and group -\nlevel analys es were conducted to determine the sensitivity of fNIRS to detecting brain activity to each task. A channel \nwas deemed activated  if there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in oxy - and a concurrent decrease in \ndeoxyhe moglobin.  \n Results: Common resting state networks  were detected in all participants with the frontoparietal and default \nmode  network s showing the highest degree of similarity across participants ( 74%). The sensitivity to the sensorimotor , \nspeech perception , motor imagery and spatial navigation tasks was 88.3%, 82.8%, 62.5% and 33.3% , respectively.  \nThese results, except for spatial navigation, are in agreement with previous fMRI studies. The low sensitivity to spatial \nnavigation is likely due to  lack of sensitivity to the parahippocampal gyrus . Of the three patients, one showed activity \nacross all tasks that was indistinguishable from healthy controls, suggesting that this patient  had a level of conscious \nthat was entirely inconsistent with their behavioural assessment of awareness .   \n Conclusion:  This study is the culmination of 4 years of data collection and analysis , where we demonstrated \nfor the first time, the ability of fNIRS to detect residual  and covert  brain function in patients with severe brain injury  \nusing a hierarchical approach . Current work aims at increasing the sample size to better assess the sensitivity and \nspecificity of our approach in patient population. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a multimodal approach \nto predict prognosis following a severe brain injury within the first few days of admission to the ICU . 61 of 398",
    "Estimating the effect of flow versus volume changes on near \ninfrared spectroscopy derived metrics  \nCameron Smith1,2, Stefan Yu Bögli1, Ihsane Olakorede1, Giada Cucciolini1, Virginia \nMotroni1, Erta Beqiri1, Aiden Chen1, Claudia Ann Smith1, Tomasso Rochat3, Marina \nSandra Cherchi1, Ronan O’Leary4, Basil Matta5, Gemma Bale2, Peter Smielewski1 \n \n1Brain Physics Laboratory, Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK \n 2Neuro Optics Lab, Division of Electrical Engineering, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK \n3Intensive Care Department, University Hospital of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland \n4Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, UK \n5Department of Anaesthesia, Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, UK \nCs2159@cam.ac.uk \n \nAbstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers the potential for monitoring autoregulation \nwithout the limitations of other methods, however, the effect of cerebral flow and volume changes \nwithin the autoregulation range require further study. Data from participants (n=34) undergoing \ntraumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment with simultaneous flow (flow velocity (FV) via transcranial \nDoppler (TCD)), volume (via intracranial pressure (ICP) probe) and NIRS was collected. Coherence \nwas calculated between ICP & NIRS and TCD & NIRS. Results show total haemoglobin (HbT) and \nICP had the highest coherence within the CAR range, deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) had the highest \ncoherence within the high-frequency CAR range (both P<0.05). \n \nIntroduction: Non-invasive assessment of cerebrovascular autoregulation (CAR) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) \nrequires a proxy measure of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and recent studies have suggested the use of near-infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRS). TCD (Transcranial Doppler) represents the gold standard for estimation of CBF (derived from \ncerebral blood flow velocity - CBFv) but necessitates high expertise. NIRS is easy to apply for prolonged periods, \nbut it specifically reflects concentrations of oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in cerebral \nblood. It remains unclear to what extent changes in NIRS represent changes in flow versus volume. \n \nMethods: 89 TBI recordings (34 patients, mean (SD) 283 (90) \nminutes) with simultaneous intracranial pressure (ICP), CBFv and \nNIRS (Masimo, USA) data were evaluated. HbO2, HHb, and total \nhaemoglobin (HbT), as well as regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) \nmetrics were analysed. The effect of ICP (representing volume) and \nCBFv (flow) changes on NIRS metrics was estimated by \ncalculating the coherence between the different power spectra of \npredetermined (CAR range 0.01-0.05 Hz) and logarithmic (8 steps \nbetween 0.001 and 0.5 Hz) frequency ranges (20-minute sliding \nwindow). \n \nResults: NIRS metrics followed a distinct coherence pattern with \nthe other signals, generally having lowest coherence in the 0.005 \nand 0.5 Hz range and peaking in the 0.02 to 0.1 Hz range. The \nhighest coherence with ICP was with HbT (p<0.001) within the \nCAR range and the highest coherence with CBFv was with HHb in \nthe high-frequency range (p=0.002), while rSO2 tended to be less coherent with either metric (not significantly). \n \nConclusion:  Flow and volume signals are differently reflected in NIRS variables depending on the frequency band \nreaching a peak in the clinically important slow wave CAR range. This seems to confirm the legitimacy of using NIRS \nfor assessment of CAR in general, but also stresses that they cannot be considered blindly as being a directly equivalent \nalternative to ICP or TCD evaluation. \n \n  \nFigure 1 Showing the coherence between various \nNIRS metrics and flow velocity and intracranial \npressure. \n62 of 398",

The effects of psychedelics on the human brain have been studied since the 1950s, \nprimarily with electroencephalography at first, then with other neuroimaging techniques. Basic research into the \neffects of psychedelics on humans is currently experiencing a resurgence, largely due to growing confirmation of the \ntherapeutic promise of psychedelics. \n \nMethods: In our contribution, we provide an overview of current neuroimaging research on psychedelics in humans, \nwith a particular focus on fNIRS studies conducted to date and the great potential of fNIRS for this type of research. \n \nResults: To date, two fNIRS studies have been published on the effects of psychedelics in humans: our 2019 single-\nsubject pilot study investigating the effects of psilocybin (17 mg) [1]; and a 2023 study investigating the effects of \nsub-anaesthetic ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) [2]. Changes in functional connectivity were observed in both studies. \n \nConclusion:  We believe that now is the time to capitalise on the momentum of the current resurgence of research into \nthe effects of psychedelics as well as the increasing advancement and popularity of the fNIRS technique to establish \nfNIRS in psychedelic research.

The method is based on\nthe Beer-Lambert law to analytically connect the spectra with concentrations and utilizes deep\nlearning to speed up the concentration inference compared to traditional optimization means. The\nresults  reveal  a  sub-second  molecular  composition  inference  and  possibility  to  contrast\nsemantically different physiological parts.\nIntroduction:  Various biomedical applications such as histopathology or neurosurgery  require access  to rapid\nmonitoring of intrinsic tissue properties. Spatially-resolved maps of the tissue characteristics would allow bypassing\ninvasive disease diagnostics, e.g., biopsy, which halt the operation.  In this work, we analyze a data-driven approach\nfor inferring molecular composition changes from broadband spectroscopy of brain tissue. \nMethods: We use a supervised data-driven approach by creating a dataset of attenuation-concentration pairs to train\na neural network. The dataset  is generated  using the modified Beer-Lambert  law connecting attenuation with\nconcentrations. We test different training strategies (on synthetic or on real data) and varying complexity of the\nphysical models (with or without scattering).\nFig. 1: Examples of an HSI image from the Helicoid dataset [1] (left). Each pixel in the shown 2D image possesses a spectral\nsignature with 826 bands.  From this signature, we predict the molecular concentration change for hemodynamic δHbT = δHbO2\n+ δHHb (middle), and metabolic δdiffCCO = δoxCCO − δredCCO characterization (right). \nResults: The figure above demonstrates predictions of the method on HSI of brain tissue.  The inferred maps of total\nhemoglobin concentration HbT contrast notably better the vessel tree compared to the RBG image. Also the inferred\nmetabolic molecules diffCCO. Importantly, such predictions are obtained in a subsecond time for the whole image,\ni.e., surgical 2D field of view of a few hundreds pixels in each dimension.  \nConclusion:  We test a data-driven approach  for inferring molecular composition on various datasets (bNIRS and\nHSI) and physical models of different complexity (with and without scattering, i.e., linear and non-linear systems).\nImportantly, we evaluate different training strategies for neural-networks-based molecular prediction substituting the\ntraditional  least-squares-fit  methods.  We  achieve  a  significant  speed-up  compared  to  traditional  least-squares\noptimization, reaching subsecond time for inferring molecular composition without a lose of accuracy.\nReference:  [1] HELICoiD project: A new use of hyperspectral imaging for brain cancer detection in real-time\nduring neurosurgical operations, Fabelo Himar et al.

Cereb Cortex.  \n Evaluating Statistical Learning with Qualitative Regressors: \nA GLM Methodology for HD-DOT Data \n \nSruthi Srinivasan, Xinyi Wang, Deepshikha Acharya, Flavia Mancini, Gemma Bale \n \n1Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge; 2Department of Physics, University of Cambridge \nss2814@cam.ac.uk \n \nAbstract:  The brain uses environmental sensory inputs to make predictions about future events, a \nprocess known as statistical learning. Since prediction confidence is a measure of the likelihood of \nprediction accuracy, it may modulate the brain’s response to prediction-making. To explore this, we \ncollected high-density diffuse optical tomography data from twenty participants tasked with playing \na stock market prediction game. A general linear model was used to fit a linear combination of \nhaemodynamic and qualitative regressors to the task-related responses. Preliminary results suggest \nthat both prediction error and confidence regressors modulate prefrontal cortex activity differently. \n \nIntroduction:  Statistical learning refers to the process by which the brain can identify meaningful patterns in sensory \ninputs received from its environment, and subsequently make informed predictions about the future. The degree to \nwhich individuals feel that their predictions are correct refers to prediction confidence, which may modulate their actual \nbrain responses. To investigate this, high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) can be used to measure task-\nrelated activity, and regional brain responses can be modelled using a general linear model (GLM). While GLM is a \nstandard event-related analysis method in other neuroimaging modalities, its application in HD-DOT, particularly with \nqualitative regressors, is limited [1]. Thus, we have designed a GLM methodology that utilises regional HD-DOT time \nseries to assess the impact of qualitative regressors, such as prediction confidence, on neural responses to gain insight \ninto statistical learning mechanisms. \n \nMethods: An event-related stock market prediction task was adapted from [2], where participants had to predict \nfluctuating stock prices over time and rate their degree of prediction confidence (150 trials per participant). Data were \nrecorded from the prefrontal cortices of 20 participants (aged 21.0 ± 4.7 years) using an HD-DOT device (LUMO; \nGowerlabs Ltd.), and subsequently pre-processed, reconstructed, and parcellated using the DOT-HUB Toolbox [3], \nToast++ [4], and Schaefer atlas [5]. The canonical HRF and its derivatives were used to fit a GLM to the average \nparcellated values of ∆HbO and ∆HbR. Qualitative regressors (Fig 1) were represented as parametric modulators \nadjusting the height of the main effect regressors, and a random-effects model was used to produce group-level results. \n \nResults: For all participants, significant \nincreases from baseline were found in ∆HbO, \ncoupled with significant decreases in ∆HbR \nfollowing onset of each event (p<.05, \nWilcoxon signed-rank test). Preliminary \nGLM results suggest that both prediction \nerror and prediction confidence modulate the \nonset of the confidence rating event at the \nindividual- and group-level, indicating that \nobserved HRF amplitudes are correlated with \nthe magnitudes of qualitative regressors (Fig \n1b and 1c) at the onset of the relevant event. \n \nConclusion:  This work is among the first to \ncombine an event-related task design with \ngroup-level GLM analysis for HD-DOT and \ndemonstrates the use of qualitative regressors \nas parametric modulators in HD-DOT responses. Preliminary results show that prediction confidence and error are \nimportant regressors to consider in statistical learning and may point to the role of prediction confidence in shaping \nneural responses to decision-making. Ultimately, this work should be expanded to fit more complex regressors to the \nobserved neural response and perform a group-level analysis across more participants.   \nFig 1.

We quantitatively evaluated image quality \nvia metrics of localization error, spatial resolution, signal to noise, and depth of field of point spread \nfunctions . While both array density and modulation frequency affect image quality , array density \nhas a far stronger effect that saturates as array density increases beyond 9 mm spacing . \nIntroduction:  Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) utilizes sets of multi -distance overlapp ing functional near -infrared  \nspectro scopy (fNIRS)  measurements  to volumetrically reconstruct 3D images of tissue oxygenation. While multiple \nstrategies for improving DOT image quality have been used, including using regular high -density grids of source -\ndetector pairs with nearest spacing less than 15 mm , or using modulated light  sources  ~100 MHz , herein  we aim to \ninvestigate the combined effects of array density and modulation frequency on the potential image quality of DOT.  \nMethods: We modelled  eight DOT arrays of sources and detectors aligned on regular interdigitating square grids (Fig. \n1a) with spacing  equal to 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 mm placed on the top surface of a slab with homogeneous optical \nproperties  (Fig. 1a-b). For eac h array, measurements with modulation frequencies of 0, 141, 300 and 500 MHz were \nsimulated.  We simulated ~85,000 point spread functions (PSFs) per model  and quantitatively evaluated the image \nquality of the PSFs with metrics of full width at half max (FWH M; the maximum distance between two voxels in PSF \nafter 50% threshold), localization error (the distance between the point perturbation and centroid of PSF), and \nlocalization depth of field  (LDOF;  maximum depth with success rate >50%) . \nResults and Conclusion : Within a depth of 4-18mm, array density is far a stronger parameter than modulation \nfrequency on image quality  (Fig. 1c). Increasing array density strongly improves the localization error , FWHM  and \nLDOF, while  the effects of modulation frequency change over different metrics. FWHM  is improved with higher \nfrequencies except for 30  mm arrays , while LDOF  is generally optimized at 300 MHz . Models (Fig. 1d-g) show  \neffects of array density and modulation frequency on localization error, FWHM, and penetration depth diminished \nwith arrays d enser than 9  mm. These asymptotic behaviors indicate that the spatial sampling of the measurements is \napproaching a maximum saturation due to the diffuse nature of NIR propagation in turbid tissues. Future directions \nwill investigate how these results can be translated to the geometry and complexity of human head , breast,  and other \ntissue models.   \n Figure 1:  a.

Online meetings where \nresearchers have control over the communication provide an ideal way to test how disruptions in \ncommunication impact on interpersonal neural synchrony.  Our fNIRS hyperscanning  study  \nsimulates online meetings  with connection breakdowns. Participants engage in a Spot the \nDifferences game, with one describing and the other identifying differences  (mutual prediction \ncondition) . Noise intermittently obscures the speaker's voice, creating partial (one -way)  and \nunsuccessful  zero prediction conditions. We  will analyze inter -brain coherence, expecting it only \nunder mutual prediction  condition s. \n \nIntroduction:  To facilitate fluent communication, it  is crucial for individuals to predict each other's actions and carry \nout their own actions effectively, a process linked to interpersonal neural coherence  (Hamilton, 2021; Kingsbury et \nal., 2019). However, breakdowns of such interpersonal communication are prevalent in online meetings due to poor \ninternet connections.  Our understanding  of how such breakdowns impact  interpersonal neural coherence  remains \nlimited.  To address these questions, we developed an fNIRS hyperscanning study simulating an online meeti ng \nsituation.  \n \nMethods: Pairs of p articipants  (n=23 typical adult  pairs to date; data collection ongoing ) sit in front of individual \ncomputer s, via which they can view the other's face  (like a Zoom call)  and see a Spot the Differences game display. \nWearing headphones, they can hear each other's voices. On each trial, one participant  - designated as the Speaker - \ndescrib es a picture, while the other  - the Listener  - uses the Speaker’s description to identify differences between the \nSpeaker’s picture and the version they can see on their own screen.  There are three experimental conditions: mutual \nprediction (speaker can be heard); partial prediction (speaker cannot be heard but is unaware of the disruption ) and no \nprediction (speaker cannot be heard and is made aware via a visual cue ).  fNIRS data is collected from 22 channels \nover the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (dlPFC) and the left temporoparietal junction  (TPJ) with a Hitachi ETG -\n4000  fNIRS system, and breathing is recorded using BiosignalsPlux  device.  The brain regions of interest have been  \nselected due to their  reported relation to communication  and interaction  (Jiang et al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). Data will \nbe analysed using wavelet coherence methods to capture when the brains of the speaker and listener show similar \npatterns of activity.  \n \nResults & Conclucions : The experiment is still in the data collection phase . We expect that inter -brain coherence \nwill be found  under mutual prediction condition, but not in the other two conditions. With data collection expected to \nconclude in May, we are confident that our results will be ready for presentation at the conference in September.   The \nresults will show if the mutual prediction model can explain patterns of brain activity in contexts with full and partial \ncommunication between people.  \n \nReferences : \nHamilton, A.

    "Characterising infant neurodevelopment in diverse settings \nusing functional change point analysis.  \nSam Beatona,b, Sam McCanna,b, Anna Blasic, Sophie E. Moorea,b and the BRIGHT Project \nTeam \t!King’s College London, London, UK  \t\"Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, The Gambia  \t#Medical physics and Biomedical Engineering dpt., U niversity College London, London, UK  \nPresenting Author email address: samuel.beaton@kcl.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  Habituation and novelty detection (HaND) supports the foundations  of learning. The \nBRIGHT Study  has already  investigated infant HaND brain responses via measured changes in the \namplitude of evoked hemodynamic responses. However, characterisation of response trajectories \nwould provide further insight into early neurodevelopment. We  identify significant changes to the \nmean structure of the haemodynamic responses using functional change point analysis . We then \ncompare volumetric calculations based on these change points to investigate variation in both the \ntiming and magnitude of infants’ hemodynamic responses during the HaND task . \nIntroduction:  The period of life from conception to two years of age is crucial for shaping neurodevelopment\t!. \nHabituation and novelty detection (HaND) provides the foundation for the processes of learning; methods that \naccurately measure these processes provide valuable insight into brain developmen t\t\". The Brain Imaging for Global \nHealth (BRIGHT) project used a n fNIRS HaND paradigm to investigate brain responses via changes in the magnitude  \nof hemodynamic responses evoked by spoken auditory stimuli in two longitudinal cohorts, in the UK (N=60) and  The \nGambia (N=204)\t#. Here we present a novel approach for the analysis of the HaND paradigm – functional change \npoint analysis (f CPA)\t$,& – applied to fNIRS data for the first time to permit the characterisation of infant HaND \nresponses.  \nMethods: Functional  change point analysis (fCPA ) is a method for time series analysis developed within the \nmathematical statistics field of  functional data analysis (FDA). Each function in FDA is viewed as representative of \ncontinuously changing underlying smooth phenomena, permitting the study of both the magnitude and shape of  data\t'. \nfCPA further exploits these characteristics to determine points of significant change in properties of the functional \nrepresentations, the property in this instance being the mean function representing  the haemodynamic response . \nResults: We demonstrate the use of fCPA to capture significant points of \nchange in the evoked hemodynamic responses due to  habituation ( Figure \n1). We  contrast results derived from comparing the (i)  timing and (ii)  \nextent of habituation for individuals, within 3 distinct timepoints at 5 -, 8- \nand 12mo nths of age , in both cohorts . These are indicated, respectively, by \n(i) instances of structural change in haemodynamic responses given by the \ntiming of change points and (ii) magnitude of the structural changes in \nhaemodynamic functions according to area -under -the-curve volumetric \ncalculations of mean responses between change points .

QT-NIRS allows users to perform pruning  efficiently , however there is no consensus on \nthreshold  values for the tool parameters in data collected in infants  and toddlers . We propose a  \nmetric to assess the impact of QT -NIRS parameters Scalp Coupling Index (SCI) and Peak Spectral \nPower (PSP) on  data retention and  quality . We d emonstrat e its application  in data collected from  \nGambian participants  tested  at 6 time points  between 5 - and 60 months  of age , and its  potential \nutility in guiding fNIRS users working with infant and toddler participants .  \nIntroduction:  Failure to manage fNIRS  signal noise appropriately can impact the ability to estimate the \n(comparatively small) evoked neurovascular haemodynamic response\t!,#. One source of noise is  poor scalp -optode \ncoupling , which has traditionally been managed by pruning channels manually  and/or based on the coefficient of \nvariation  or low -intensity values , often requiring  manual selection of motion -free segments of data\t$. QT-NIRS is a \npackage which identifies channels to be pruned based on measures of two quantitative properties of the signal\t%, \npotentially permitting  more accurate channel -pruning . fNIRS studies using infant  and child  participants  - in whom \nphysiological signal components , skull anatomy , and prevalence of motion artifacts differ  from  adult counterparts\t& - \nmay also benefit from this approach . However , threshold values for parameters in QT -NIRS are as -yet unexplored for \nthis age demographic , or populations with afro textured or braided hair.  \nMethods: This work utili sed fNIRS data from ~200 Gambian infant part icipants , collected using the NTS -UCL \nsystem  (Gowerlabs LTD ). Data included  two experimental paradigms at  5-, 8-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 60  months of age , \nacquired  from 34 channels over the frontal and temporal lobes . We examine d the effect of changing QT-NIRS \nthreshold values for two quantitative signal prop erties . The first , the scalp -coupling index (SCI),  is a measure of  cross -\ncorrelation  of the two wavelength  signals in a n optical channel  in the cardia c frequency range ; higher values indicate  \nthe strong presence of the cardiac signal  which is associated with good optode coupling. The second , the peak spectral \npower (PSP)  of the cross -correlated signals , account s for erroneously high SCI values caused by  motion artifacts\t%.  \nResults: We investigate d the effect of  adjusting  threshold values on  \nparticipant -level measures of (i)  ROI signal -to-noise (SNR := 20log!'(())⁄, \nwhere ( and )\tare the me an and S.D. of concentration change data, \nrespectively ) and (ii) channel exclusion . We also propose a new metric  which \ncombines measures (i) and (ii) : (ROI SNR )/(#channel s exclu ded), with  larger \nvalues indicative of a desirable bal ance of data quality and retention . We \nexplored the effect of changing  threshold values  at different time points , with \nparticular focus on the new proposed metric  (Figure 1).   \nConclusion:  Our proposed metric may provide guidance for fNIRS users \nlooking prune channels  within infant  and todd ler fNIRS studies  using  QT-\nNIRS , by helping to s et QT-NIRS threshold parameters . We view this work to \nbe of  particular  interest for  those working with small sample sizes  and others for  whom data retention is vital .

Brain imaging was conducted in one month and one-year post-\nCI on 22 recipients and on 17 normal-hearing subjects, including resting state and task-based \nexperiments. Significant correlations were observed between average contra-lateral CMFC and CI \nspeech outcomes, particularly in angular gyrus links. Task-induced CMFC was significantly higher \nin CI users compared to NH subjects, indicating stronger reliance on cross-modal activities post-\nimplantation. Proximity of the auditory cortex to the visual cortex significantly contributes to post-\nCI CMFC. \n \nIntroduction:  This study explores task-induced cross-modal functional connectivity (CMFC) in post-lingually deaf \ncochlear implant (CI) users, focusing on the interaction between visual and auditory brain regions during visual and \naudio tasks. We employ fNIRS recordings at one month and one-year post-implantation to investigate speech \ncomprehension correlations. \n \nMethods: Inspired by Psychophysiological Interactions as a measure of task-induced functional connectivity, we \naddress its limitations by utilizing resting-state recordings instead of short intervals between task trials to establish \nbaseline functional connectivity. \n (a) Experimental design: Participants (including 22 CI users, 17 normal hearing subjects) engage in task-based \nlistening sessions followed by a 5-minute resting state. Functional connectivity (FC) matrices from both sessions \nare calculated, with resting-state FC serving as baseline for task-related FC assessment. (b) Cross-modal connectivity: Illustration of auditory-visual cortex connections examined in the study.  \nResults: Significant negative correlations were observed between average contra-lateral task-induced CMFC from the \nangular gyrus to the visual cortex and speech outcomes, based on both fNIRS recordings at one month and one-year \npost-device activation ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, FDR corrected). CMFC from the angular gyrus exceeded that of superior \ntemporal gyrus, in line with brain economy principles ( p < 0.05). CI users exhibited significantly higher CMFC than \nnormal hearing subjects, indicating their reliance on cross-modal activities even one year after implantation ( p < 0.01). \n70 of 398",
    "Evaluating neurologic recovery following acute injury : \nmeasuring residual brain activity using fNIRS  \n \nMatthew Kolisnyk1, Karnig Kazazian1, Ira Gupta1, Garima Gupta1, Reza Moulavi Ardakani1, Androu \nAbdalmalak1, Sergio Novi1, Teneille E. Gofton1, Loretta Norton1, Derek B. Debicki1 and Adrian M. Owen1 \n \n1. Western Institute of Neuroscience, Western University, London, Canada .  \nPresenting Author email address: mkolisny@uwo.ca  \n \nAbstract:  This study explores whether  fNIRS can be used to predict outcome s of acutely brain -\ninjured patients. Fourteen non-responsive patients were recruited after admission to the intensive \ncare unit . Patients ’ residual task-based brain activity was measured  at the bedside using a 129-\nchannel fNIRS  system while they listened to different movie narrative s. Using three validated \nanalys is methods, b etween 20-36% of patients’  movie -related neural responses were statistically \nsimilar to controls  (n =51) . While  most outcomes are undetermined pending ongoing  data collection , \nthe results provide early support for this  methodology , as the degree of similarity was shown to be \nprognostic in two patients . \n \nIntroduction:  Predicting whether acutely brain -injured patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) \nwill survive is challenging due to a lack of sensitive prognostic tools. Because of  this, life -changing and time -sensitive \ndecisions, including  whether to withdraw life -sustaining measures, are often  made in the absence of complete \ninformation. Evolving research has shown the benefit of using neuroimaging in the ICU to measure  residual brain \nactivity in these patients in response to different experimental tasks. One such task - listening to movie narratives  - \nreliably engage s a rich network of functions  in healthy controls , including those that underlie language, attention, and \nemotional processing. In this preliminary study, we assess whether the extent to which acutely brain -injured patients \nshow res idual brain activity in response to these narratives is predictive of subsequent neurologic recovery.  \n \n Methods: Fourteen acutely brain -injured patients were recruited from the ICU  in London Health Sciences \nCentre, London, Ontario, Canada. All patients were entirely behaviourally non -responsive at the time of testing. The \npatients listened to a 5.5 -minute auditory narrative  from the film Taken  and a scrambled control version of that clip , \nwhich was created by  spectrally rotating the  audio  of the narrative , a procedure that  maintains lower -level auditory \ninformation  but renders the narrative indecipherable . FNIRS data were acquired with a continuous -wave system \n(NIRScoutXP, NIRx Medical Systems; Berlin, Germany) with 32 sources and 39 detectors, allowing  measurement \nfrom  121 regular and eight short channels, with probe coverage including the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe s. \nThe data w ere corrected for motion artifacts, band -pass filtered, and short channels were regressed. Patients' neural \n(both HbO and HbR) response s to both clips were compared to that of a sample of healthy controls ( n = 51) using \nthree previously validated analyses. The first analysis measured the similarity between each patient's neural response \nto that of controls. In a second analysis , a machine learning approach  was trained  to decode the regular and scrambled \nclips based on control data , and then applied that decoder to the patient data. Finally, the third analysis assessed the \nsize of the correlation between the patients ’ neural response s and a qualitative measure of the feelings of suspense felt \nby a separate grou p of controls while listening to the movie  narrative . \n \n Results: In the first analysis, 3/14 patients had similarity scores that were within the range of controls. The \nsecond  analysis  found  that the  machine learning approach could accurately distinguish between  the regular and \nscrambled clip s in 4/14 patients. Finally, the qualitative analysis revealed that the neural responses of 5/15 patients \nwere  significantly correlated with independent ratings of suspense by healthy controls . There was good agreement \nbetween  which patients were identified using  the different analy tical approaches. Critically, these measures provided \naccurate prognostic information. One patient, who was found to be similar to controls in each analysis approach, \nrecovered from their acute brain injury, whereas another patien t, whose neural response was consistently dissimilar  \nacross analyses , died from their injuries.  While the prognostic value of this approach for the rest of the group is still \npending (subject to further patient testing ) the results from these  two patients are encouraging . \n \n Conclusion:  FNIRS can be used to identify that s ome acutely brain -injured patients show striking similarity \nto controls in their neural response to movie narratives.  Systemically and robustly quantifying this similarity may \nprovide essential and time -sensitive prognostic information  to assist in clinical decision making . 71 of 398",
    "Prefrontal function of frustration regulation  in young children \n \nYanwei Li1, Xia Chi2 \n \n1 Nanjing Xiaozhuang University, College of Early Childhood Education, Nanjing, China  \n2 Women’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Jiangsu, China  \nEmail addres s: liyanwei@njxzc.edu.cn  (Dr. Li) ; chixia2001@njmu.edu.cn ( Dr. Chi)  \n \nAbstract:  The c urrent research aim ed to examine the prefrontal neural activations  that underl ie \nfrustration  regulation  among young children . Sixty-two 3 - to 6-year-old children participated in our \nstudy and completed  a novel emotion regulation task, the Super Buyer Game , while their DLPFC \nwas monitored by fNIRS. The r esults showed that children reported higher  negative emotion scores \nin the frustration condition  than in  the other three  emotion regulation  strategy conditions . The \nDLPFC exhibited decreas ed neural activation  in the regulation  conditions  (i.e., distraction, \nruminat ion, and reappraisal ) compared to  the frustration condition, highlighting the involvement  of \nthe DLPFC in the frustration  regulation circuit . \n \nIntroduction:  Recent ly, there has been a surge of interest in  exploring the neural mechanisms underlying  frustration \nin preschoolers (Grabell et al., 2022; Perlman et al., 2014) . However, little is known  about the neural mechanisms \nunderlying the modulation of frustration  in young children , especially  when considering the role of cognitive \nstrategies at the neural level . The p refrontal cortex has been considered a region  that underlie s vital cognitive \nfunctions and  emotion  regulation  (Barbas & García -Cabezas, 2017; Gray et al., 2002) . Distraction , rumination,  and \nreappraisal  have been  considered  as emotion regulation  strategies for young children  (Dennis & Kelemen, 2009) . \nTherefore , our study aimed  to examine  the prefrontal neural activation s underlying distraction , rumination, and \nreappraisal  during  a frustration task among preschool ers. \n \nMethods:  Sixty -two typically developing children  (28 boys) , aged 3 to 6 \nyears (M = 4.15 years, SD = 0.64) , completed  the task. The protocol was \nreviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Board , and all \nfamilies provided written informed consent for each child participant.  \n \nChildren were asked to  complete  a novel frustration task, the Super Buyer \nGame, which was adapted  from “Incredible Cake Kids” (Grabell et al., 2019) , \nwhile the hemodynamic response in their dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex \n(DLPFC) was monitored using LIGHTNIRS  (Shimadzu Co rp.). Participants  \nwere asked to choose  the chef ’s favorite  food to receive  their preferred  gift \nas a reward  for winning the game , similar  to the FETCH  paradigm  designed \nfor young children  (Perlman et al., 2014) . Thirty -five trials  were divided into \nseven blocks , consist ing of 20 trials with negative feedback and 15 trials with \npositive feedback.  Each block consists of  five trials , including one trial  with \nopposite feedback . A distraction  or rumination condition (20 seconds) was \narranged  immediately  after the frustrat ing condition . Two of the win ning \nblocks were followed by a frustration situation , giving children a chance to \nrepair . Children reported their emotion s on a five-point scale , ranging from  \nthe most positive  (1) to neutral ( 3) to the most negative  (5) after each block . \n \nResults: Children reported more negative emotions during  frustration blocks compared to  distraction, ruminat ion, and \nreappraisal  blocks (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference among emotion scores for distraction, rumination, \nand reappraisal blocks (p > 0.05). DLPFC activation images between frustration blocks versus emotion regulation \nstrategy blocks are displayed  in Fig. 1. As illustrated , the distraction (Fig. 1a), ruminat ion (Fig. 1b), and reappraisal  \nblocks (Fig. 1c) elicited significantly decreas ed oxy-hemoglobin concentration compared to the frustration blocks with \np < 0.05 (FDR corrected). Furtherm ore, the distraction and reappraisal  blocks elicited a decreased concentration of \noxygenated  hemoglobin  compared to the ruminate blocks (p < 0.001, Sidak corrected). There w ere no significant \ndifference s in DLPFC activation between the distraction blocks and the repair blocks (p > 0.05).  \n \nConclusion s: The DLPFC  is engaged in the emotion regulation circuit . Distraction , ruminat ion, and reappraisal  are \neffective emotion regulation strategies for  frustration among  young children . \nFig. 1  Channel-space maps on the left and right DLPFC showing oxygenated -hemoglobin differences \nbetween winning versus frustration blocks.

There are various feedback methods, and so far, five \ntypes of subjective impressions have been evaluated using images, warnin g sounds, and \nannouncements. However, as subjective evaluation alone may lead to responses that intentionally \nor unintentionally influence the outcome of the experiment, we focused on the brain, which is \nprocessing the information, and evaluated feedback by measuring brain activity with NIRS.  The \nresults of the experiment indicated that the brain may be activated to process information for those \nwith high subjective evaluation  content. \n \nIntroduction:  The number of accidents involving elderly people in automobiles remains high, and measures to \nprevent accidents are needed, one of which is to focus on driver awareness. In this study , aims to realize a real -time \nfeedback system that encourages drivers to continuously increase their awareness of safe driving. There are various \nmethods of feedback, and  our previous  study have evaluated subjective impressions with five types of content, \nincluding image,  sound, and announcement.  However, as subjective evaluation alone may lead to responses that \nintentionally or unintentionally influence the outcome of the experiment, we focused on the brain, which processes \ninformation, and measured brain activity  using NIRS to evaluate feedback b ased on subjective and human \nphysiological responses.  Until now, various studies have examined the relationship between subjective evaluation \nand brain activity, but only a few studies have used brain activity to evaluate feedback content from the perspect ive \nof processing information during driving. Therefore, in this study, the degree of information processing in response \nto feedback is evaluated by the brain by focusing on brain activity during driving.  \n \nMethods: A driving simulation experiment was conducted using a robot that mimicked a car. In the experiment, one \nof five different feedbacks on emergency braking was presented for 10 seconds, during which brain activity in the \nprefrontal cortex was measured using 2ch NIRS (NeU/HOT -2000). The same experiment was repeated for 3 days.  \nSubjects were 18 healthy elderly men and women (11 males, mean age 74.2 ± 3.0 years) with driving licenses.  Passed \nthe University of Electro -Communications(No.22015) and T OYOTA(No.2023TMC 70)'s ethics review.  \n \nResults: To compare brain activity between subjects, data normalization was  performed . The average brain activity \nof 18 people was calculated and used as the representative value (Fig ure1). For both left and right brain activity, a \nWilcoxon signed rank test was performed between each item, and multiple \ncomparisons were made with Bonferroni correction.  Figure1 shows that \n\"Image + Announce\" has significantly higher values than the others for \nboth the left and right sides.  The results of the subjective evaluation also \nshowed that it was the highest rated, indicating that brain activity was \nactive, and that the information was p rocessed well for the best subjective \nevaluation. \n \nConclusion:   \nThis study focused on the brain, which processes information, and \nevaluated feedback during driving using brain activity.  The results showed \nthat ' Image + Announce' was the feedback with the highest subjective \nevaluation and the possibility that the brain can process the information.  \nIn the future, we will model not only subjectivity and the brain, but also \nvarious personal information and feedback.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure1: Average brain  activity \nerror bar: standard deviation   \nsignificant differences all items -4-3-2-10123456LeftRight\n73 of 398",
    "Functional identification of language-responsive channels in \nindividual participants in fNIRS investigations \n \nLUO Haolun1, LI Qun2, SHENG Li1, WEN Jian2, ZHOU Hui3 \n \n1. Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, Faculty of Humanities, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China  \n2. Department  of O torhinolaryngology -Head and Neck surgery , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu, China  \n3. Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital , Chengdu, China  \nPresenting Author email address: haolun .luo@connect.polyu.hk  \n \nAbstract:  fNIRS studies on language processing faced challenges in aligning optodes on the scalp \nwith anatomical or functional regions of underlying cortex . This study adopted the functional \nchannel of interest (fCOI) analysis  to circumvent this challenge , which involve d identifying \nchannels of interest individually  based on functional response properties . The response profiles of \nthese channels then were  tested using independent data.  Using this approach, cortical regions with \npreferential responses to  linguistics material  versus  perceptually -matched control  were observed \nreliably in adults , with  no response  in this region  to nonlinguistic function . By contrast, standard \nfixed -array analysis  did not reliably reveal  significant responses  to language .  \n  \nIntroduction:  Making meaningful inferences about the functional architecture of the language system requires the \nability to refer to the same cortical regions  across individuals and research . However,  it is difficult to map the \nmeasurement channels to specific underlying regions of cortex  (Powell et al., 201 8). fCOI analysi s has been  proved  \nbe a more sensitive method for identifying  selective regions  of face, scene , and theory of mind in both adults and \ninfants ( Liu et al. , 2022).  This study  extended th is approach to fNIRS investigations of language processing.  \nMethods: Sixteen university students  with normal or corrected -to-normal  vision and no reported hearing loss \nparticipated in  two tasks: a n auditory language localizer task  (adapted from Scott et al. 2017)  and a spatial working \nmemory task  (adapted from Fedorenko et al. 2011) . In the localizer task, participants listened to intact and degraded \naudio clips from a Chinese version of Alice in Wonderland. Each run consisted of two 18s blocks of the intact and \ndegraded  audio type , with a 10s fixation at the beginning of each block. In the spatial working memory task, \nparticipants tracked four (easy) or eight (hard) locations on a 3 × 4 grid and then chose the correct grid in a two -choice \nquestion.  The fNIRS measurements were recorded  with 78-channel  system  (NirSmart , HuiChuang,  China ). Data were \nthen preprocessed using the HomER NIRS processing package (Huppert  et al.,  2009) . We first took the standard fixed -\narray analysis  for different condition contrast s with Bonferroni  correction . Then, in fCOI analysis, we defined the \nfCOI within participants using a leave -one-run-out procedure  (Liu et al., 2022). Specifically,  for each participant, one \nrun of data  from the  localizer task  is left  out iteratively  while the remaining runs are used to define the fCOI. The fCOI \nidentified was  used to extract a response for each condition from left -out run . For each participant, data extracted from \neach left-out run were averaged for each condition. These averaged values were then used in one -sided t -tests to \ncompare the difference in HbO concentration  between intact and degraded audio conditions, as well as between hard \nand easy conditions. The time window for the analysis was from 1 second after block onset until the end of the block.  \nResults: For the selected language  fCOIs , the mean HbO2 concentration  in the left -out data was significantly higher \nfor the intact  audio trials  than that for the degraded audio  (t= 7.38, p<.0001). But fCOI s did not show  significant \ndifference between the hard and the easy conditions in the spatial working memory task (t=0.376, p=.35). The result s \nconfirm the reliable functional selectivity,  consistent with previous findings revealed in fMRI study ( Fedorenko et al. \n2011) . In the fixed -array analysis , none of the channels exhibited significantly higher HbO2 concentration when \nlistening to the intact  audio  compared to the degraded audio .  \nConclusion:  This study confirms language selectivity in human brain and establish the feasibility of identifying \nlanguage -responsive channels  at the individual level by fNIRS. The findings  provide evidence that the fCOI analysis  \nshowed better sensitivity  than the currently widely -used fixed -array analysis . \nReference:  \nFedorenko, E. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

    "Differences between Smartwatch- Measured Sleep Data and \nSubjective Sleep Rating: A fNIRS Pilot Study \n \nZilu Liang, Marina Saskovets \n \nUbiquitous and Personal Computing Lab, Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS) ,   \nPresenting Author email address:  2022md03@kuas.ac.jp  \n \nAbstract:  This study explores  the differences between smartwatch -measure sleep data an d \nsubjective sleep rating from a neuroscience  perspective . Cortical hemodynamics were monitored  \nusing a  wearable fNIRS  (Artinis Brite 24 ). Objective sleep data were collected using  Fitbit Sense , \nwhile  subjective sleep ratings were obtained on a 1 –5 Likert scale.  The findings suggested that \nhigher  subjective sleep rating  may be positively correlated  to increased hemodynamics, whereas \nobjective sleep data measured by Fitbit present an opposite trend. This indicates  that users’ \nsubjective perception of sleep and the data collected by consumer smart watches  may be measuring  \ndistinct  aspects  of sleep  quality . \n \nIntroduction:  Consumer sm artwatches  such as Fitbit are gaining great popularity in recent years. However, users \noften complain that their sleep tracking data mismatch their subjective sleep experience. The discrepancy between \nsmartwa tch sleep  data and subjective sleep quality has been routinely attributed to the limited accuracy of consumer -\ngrade wearable devices in measuring sleep. In our pilot study, we explored the differences between smartwatch -\nmeasure sleep data and subjective sleep rating from a neuroscience perspective.  \n \nMethods: We investigated the associations of subjective sleep rating and Fitbit measured sleep data to cortical \nhemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the first sleep cycle. We adopted the N -of-1 single subject \nresearch design and collected 15 nights of  data from one healthy male participant who is Caucasian and was in his \n30s. Cortical hemodynamics were measured using an Artinis Brite 24 system. Optodes were arranged following the \n27-channel template. The optodes were fixed on a soft neoprene head cap and were placed between the FpZ -F3-Cz-\nF4-FpZ region according to the international 10 –20 EEG system. All the measurements wer e conducted online, where \nthe Brite 24 device was connected to OxySoft via Bluetooth and data were regularly streamed to the OxySoft. The \nraw optical density (OD) signals recorded with Brite 24 were exported into EDF files using the companion software \nOxySoft. The OD signals of each night were trimmed between sleep st art time TS (as recorded by the Fitbit Sense) \nand TS+ 90min, which is the average length of a sleep cycle in healthy adults. The OD signal quality of each channel \nwas analyzed using the scalp coupling index (SCI) method. Channels with an SCI below 0.75 wer e discarded. The \nOD signals were converted to hemoglobin blood oxygen change using the modified Beer -Lambert law (MBLL), and \nbandpass filtered (0.02 –0.18 Hz) to remove the cardiac and respiratory noises. Five time -domain features (i.e., mean, \nmedian, stand ard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) and three frequency -domain features (i.e., total power, peak amplitude \nof the frequency components, peak ratio) were derived from the hemoglobin oxygen change signals of each channel \nand then averaged across all channels.  Fitbit Sense —the latest Fitbit model at the time of the study —was used to \nmeasure a set of sleep metrics, including total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), wake ratio (WR), \nlight sleep ratio (LR), deep sleep ratio (DR), REM sleep ratio (RR), and sleep score (SS).  Subjective  sleep was rated \non a 1 –5 Likert scale, with higher score denoting better sleep.  \n \nResults: Correlation analysis results showed that subjective sleep rating mainly correlated to the median of the ΔO2Hb \nand ΔHHb signals in a set of channels, with positive correlation coefficients. In contrast, the sleep score computed by \nFitbit mainly correlated t o the mean of the ΔO2Hb and ΔHHb signals in a different set of channels, with negative \ncorrelation coefficients .  \n \nConclusion:  The findings suggested that better perceived sleep quality may be positively associated to increased \nhemodynamics during the first sleep cycle, and the opposite may be true for objective sleep metrics such as sleep score \nmeasured by Fitbit. The result impl ies that users’ subjective perception of sleep and the smart watches may be \nmeas uring distinct asp ects of sleep. As such, improving device accuracy may help little in addressing the discrepancy \nbetween the subjective sleep experience and the objective data. The findings provided design implications for the \ndevelopment of future sleep tracking technologies .  75 of 398",
    "Left fetal temporal sulcus depth predicts  speech \ndiscrimination abilities at birth  \n \nMandl, S1, Kienast, P2, Kasprian , G2, Alexopoulos, J3, Seidl, R1, Bartha-Doering, L1 \n \n1Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria  \n2Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image -guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria  \n3Department of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria  \nPresenting Author email address: sophie.mandl@meduniwien.ac.at  \n \nAbstract: This pilot study examined the longitudinal relationship between superior temporal sulcus \n(STS) depth in fetuses and their speech discrimination abilities  at birth . Overall, n eonates had a \nsignificantly larger hemodynamic response to forward than to backward speech, particularly in the \nleft hemisphere. Importantly, a  deeper left fetal STS correlated with decreased activation within  the \nright hemisphere during neonatal speech discrimina tion. We hypothesize that earlier fetal \ndevelopment of the left STS is beneficial  for speech perception abilities at birth.   \n \nIntroduction:  In most fetuses, s tructural brain asymmetry becomes apparent early in development, with the STS \nshowing a rightward depth asymmetry by the 23rd gestational week [1]. As the STS is involved in auditory processing \nand spoken language comprehension, STS depth may be an anatomical marker for later language development  [2]. \nThe aim of this preliminary study was to examine whether fetal STS depth predicts  neonatal speech discrimination \nabilities using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  \n \nMethods: To date, 15 neonates who se mothers  had undergone fetal MRI due to clinical rea sons have been  included \nin the study. Fetal  STS depth was measured as de scribed in Kasprian et al. [1]. After birth, neonatal speech \ndiscrimination was investigated using a NIRSport2  optical topography system with 24 channels and a speech forward \nversus backward  paradigm  [3]. The fNIRS data  was preprocessed using HomER3. After exclusion of 6 neonates due \nto motion -related artifacts, 9 neonates (3 girls) were included in the final analysis . A repeated measures ANOVA was \nconducted with condition (forward/backward speech) and hemis phere (left/right) as within -subject factors. Post -hoc \nanalyses of main effects were calculated using paired  sample  t-tests. Partial correlation analyses controlling for fetal \nage at MRI were performed to examine the relationship between fetal STS  depth  and speech discrimination at  birth.  \n \nResults: The ANOVA  found a significant main effect of c ondition  (F(1,8) = 8.5, p = .019) , but not for hemisphere \n(F(1,8) = .085, p = .778) nor for condition x hemisphere (F(1,8) = .154, p = .706). Post-hoc paired sample t -tests \nrevealed an increase in HbO concentration during forward  speech  (M = .059, SD = .106) and a  decrease  during \nbackward  speech  (M = -.050, SD = .065, t(8) = 3.118, p = .014). This difference in HbO concentration between forward \nand backward speech was significant in the left (t(8) = 2.954, p = .018), but not in the right hemisphere (t(8) = 1.954, \np = .086). Partial co rrelation analyses showed that left fetal STS depth negatively co rrelated with the difference in \nHbO concentration between speech forward and speech backward in the right hemisphere (r = -.883, p = .004).  \n \nConclusion:  These preliminary findings support  previous studies  showing that neonates are able to neurally \ndiscriminate between forward and backward speech shortly after birth . Importantly, the present study suggests that \nthe fetal depth of the left STS has a predictive value for speech discrimination at birth . More specifically, in fetuses \nwith a deeper STS in  the left hemisphere , the right hemisphere is less involved  in speech discrimination  at birth. These \nresults align with our recent  study, which found  that less rightward asymmetry of the fetal STS predicts better verbal \nabilities 6 to 13 years later [2] . However, given the small sample size, the present findings must be interpreted with \ncaution and data collection will continue until fall 2024.  \n \nReferences  \n1. Kasprian, G. et al.

    "Aberrant Neural Response and Eye Gaze Pattern in G irls \nwith Fragile X Syndrome \n \nShuo Guan1, Danyong Feng1, Yuhang Li1, Allan L. Reiss3, Rihui Li1,2  \n \n1 Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Institute of Collaborative Innovation, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau S.A.R., China , \n2 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau S.A.R ., China  \n3 Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research , Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA ,  \nemail address: rihuili@ um.edu.mo  \nAbstract:  Fragile X syndrome (FXS) presents significant challenges in social interaction, yet \nunderstanding the neural mechanisms and associated behaviors in affected individuals  remains \nlimited. We employed fNIRS  and eye gaze tracking to investigate brain dynamics and eye gaze \nbehavior during  face-to-face conversation in 35 girls with FXS and 31 matched controls. FXS girls \nexhibited hyperactivity in  prefrontal and temporal cortical  areas  alongside reduced eye contact and \naberrant  gaze patterns. Correlational analyses showed  a close  association between the aberrant brain \nactivity and gaze behaviors. These findings shed light on FXS's neural underpinnings in social \ncontexts, offering potential targets for therapeutic interventions .  \nIntroduction:  Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, affecting \napproximately 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 7000 females worldwide. Individuals with FXS often exhibit significant \nsymptoms of avoidance, anxiety, and hyperarousal , particularly in response to daily social interaction. However, little \nis currently known about the aberrant patterns of brain neural response and biobehavioral such as eye gaze movement \nin girl with FXS, an important but understudied clinical population.  The present study sought to characterize brain \nnetwork properties and eye gaze patterns in girls with FXS during natural face -to-face conversation s. \nMethods: We recruited 35 girls with FXS (11.35±3.07 years) as the FXS group, and 31 age - and developmentally \nmatched (i.e., verbal IQ, autism -related social behavior, executive function) girls as the control group (11.41±2.32 \nyears). A portable brain imaging technique called functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an eye gaze \ntracker were used to measure the hemodynamic response and eye gaze movement of each participant during a \nstructured face -to-face conversation with a researcher, respectively . \nResults: Compared to the control group, girls with FXS exhibit ed significantly enhanced  inter-regional functional \nconnectivity and greater nodal strength within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye field (FEF) , and superior \ntemporal gyrus (STG) during the conversation. \nMoreover, girls with FXS showed significantly less eye \ncontact with their conversational partner s and more \nunregulated eye gaze behavior than the control group. \nWithin the FXS group, correlational analysis was \nperformed between the aberrant brain network measures \nand eye gaze behaviors. We found that greater nodal \nstrength at left and right STG were significantly \nassociated with higher eye gaze  fixations on research’s \neye region in girls with FXS. We also found that nodal \nstrength at the left FEF, and functional connectivity \nbetween the left and right FEF, were negatively \ncorrelated with mean saccade duration when the FXS \ngirls were engaging in the conversation.  \nConclusion:  Through the simultaneous brain -eye gaze \nmeasurement, for the first time, we provide preliminary \nevidence for linking the aberrant neural response of girls \nwith FXS to their abnormal eye gaze behaviors during \nnaturalistic social interaction. The findings here thus \nexpand our current knowledge of the neural mechanisms \nand eye gaze behaviors underlying naturalistic social \ninteraction in girls with FXS .   \nFigure1:  Scheme of brain -gaze correlational analysis . \nROI-based network\nfNIRS signal\neye gaze tracking signalPreprocessing\nEye gaze behavior coding\nA\nDB\nC\n77 of 398",

The system is applied on ex vivo  biopsies of glioma from routine patients, \nincluding different tumour gradings . Quantitative analysis of the composition of the tissue is \nperformed via fast spectral unmixing to map biomarkers, such as oxy - and deoxyhaemoglobin, \ncytochrome -c-oxidase and lipid content . The versatili ty of HyperProbe1 can enable its \nutilisation as investigative tool to provide tailored HSI technology , that could be translated into \nthe clinics as compact, cost -effective prototypes for intraoperative neuronavigation.  \n \nIntroduction: Histopathological examination of surgical biopsies, such as in cerebral glioma and glioblastoma \nresection, is hindered in current clinical practice by the long times required for the laboratory pathological \nscreening, typically taking several days or even weeks to be completed.  We propose here a transportable, high -\ndensity, spectral -scanning based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) setup, named HyperProbe1, that can provide in situ , \nfast biochemical analysis and mapping of fresh surgical tissue samples, less than 1 hour  after excision, and without \nthe need of fixing, staining nor compromising the integrity of the biopsies . \nMethods: HyperProbe1 is based on spectral scanning via supercontinuum laser (SCL) illumination filtered with \nacousto -optic tuneable filters (AOTF). Such methodology allows the user to select any number and type of \nwavelength bands in the visible and near -infrared ( NIR) range between 510 and 900 nm, and to reconstruct 3D \nhypercubes composed of high -resolution (4 -5 µm) widefield images (0.9x0.9 mm2) of the surgical samples . \nResults: The HyperProbe1 setup was characterised and then applied on fresh surgical biopsies of glioma from \nroutine patients, including different grades of tumour classification. Quantitative analysis of the composition of \nthe tissue is performed via fast spectral unmixing algorithms to reconstruct mapping of major biomarkers within \nthe samples, such as oxy - (HbO 2) and deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb), as well as cytochrome -c-oxidase (CCO).   \nConclusions: A proof -of-concept of the performances of HyperProbe1 for quantitative, biochemical mapping of \nsurgical biopsies is demonstrated, paving the way for improving current, histopathological practice via non -\ndestructive, in situ  streamlined screening of fresh tissue samples within  1 hour after excision.  The versatility of \nHyperProbe1 can also enable its utilisation as investigative tool in neuro -oncology, and provide tailored HSI \ntechnology translatable  into the clinics as compact, cost -effective prototypes for intraoperative neuronavigation.  \nFig. 1 Schematics (a) and pictures (b, c) of the HyperProbe1 setup ; (d) Inferred HbT  (top)  and diffCCO (bottom) \nconcentration maps of a biopsy sample; ( e) Distribution means of diffCCO and HbO 2 concentrations suggest that these \nparameters could be able to distinguish lower and higher grade samples of glioma tissue.  \n(d) \n(e) \n78 of 398",

To understand and maximise these social benefits, this work examines \nthe development of neural  synchrony  and motor coordination , alongside changes in social \nwellbeing,  in same -generation and intergenerational pairs across six social interactions.  This \nongoing research demonstrates that self-reported loneliness decrease s and closeness within pairs \nincrease s across six sessions. Comparing the first and sixth session s, behavioural indices of \ncollaboration stay stable for same -generation pairs and improve for intergenerational pairs . Analyses \nof neural synchrony  and motor coordination  will assess  changes across repeated colla borative  \ninteractions  within and between generations.  \n \nIntroduction:  Repeated social interactions between generations can enhance social connectedness and wellbeing, but \nlittle is known about the behavioural and neural mechanisms that underpin these social outcomes or how these \nmechanisms develop as intergenerational relati onships take shape. Subconscious coordination of body movements \nand shared patterns of brain activity are believed to underpin smooth social interactions, yet the evidence for this \ncomes from one -off interactions between members of the same (young adult) g eneration. Our preregistered study \nexamines changes in neural synchrony  and motor coordination  between members of the same and different generations \nlongitudinally across repeated social interactions.  \n \nMethods: Sixty  dyads comprising participants from the same generation (both aged 18 -35 years ) or different \ngenerations (one aged 18 -35, other aged 70+  years ) completed six collaborative art sessions together. At each session, \nparticipants drew alone and together with oil pastels while we measured neural synchrony  and motor coordination  \nusing functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)  and motion tracking , respectively. We also measured \nparticipants’ appraisal of their generation and the other generation and loneliness at the beginning of each session, as \nwell as participants’ appraisals of how socially close they felt to their partner after the drawing ac tivity  (Figure 1) .  \n \nResults: Findings from this ongoing research suggest  that self -reported loneliness decreases and feeling s of closeness \nwithin dyads increase across the six sessions. Comparing the first and sixth session s, behavioural measures of \ncollaboration remain stable  for same -generation pairs and improve for intergenerational pairs . Neural synchrony  and \nmotor coordination  analyses  will focus on changes across repeated colla borative  interactions, where we will evaluate \nour preregistered hypothesis of  increasing similarity in the degree of neural synchrony across six sessions, with a more \nmarked change in intergenerational than same -generation pairs.  \n  \nConclusion:  This work offers a deeper understanding of how motor coordination and neural synchrony support social \ninteraction among same - and mixed -generation pairs, thereby bolstering  the evidence base for initiatives and programs \nfostering wellbeing across the lifespan.  \n \nFigure 1.

    "Changes in cortical hemodynamics after an individually \ntailored virtual reality intervention in children with \nDevelopmental Coordination Disorder – An intervention \nprotocol \n \nMaja Van Grinderbeek1, Alessandro Crippa2, Pieter Meyns1, Evi Verbecque1, Katrijn \nKlingels1  \n \n1 Rehabilitation Research Centre - REVAL, Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium . ² Child \nPsychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea – Ass. La Nostra Famiglia, Bosisio Parini (LC), Italy  \nMaja.vangrinderbeek@uhasselt.be  \n \nAbstract:  Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) often experience postural \ncontrol problems , situated in the different systems of postural control. Therefore, we propose an \nindividuali zed training approach based on the child’s specific postural control profile . Interventions \nin children with DCD can modulate brain activity, measurable with functional Near -Infrared \nSpectroscopy while performing balance tasks. The central aim is to provide novel insights on \nneurophysiological processes and the potential neuroplastic changes after a postural control \nintervention in children with DCD.  This protocol introduces a new type of intervention  providing \ninsights in the changes in brain activity in children with DCD after intervention.  \n \nIntroduction:  Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with problems in the \nacquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills. Postural control problems are one of the most prevalent \ndifficulties in these children (60 -87%), with  a significant impact on daily life. Postural control is multisystemic . At \ngroup level, children with DCD present with difficulties in several systems such as limits of stability and anticipatory \npostural adjustment, although at individual level not all ch ildren experience problems in the same systems. Starting \nfrom these considerations, we propose an individuali zed targeted training approach based on the child’s specific \nprofile to improve their postural control. The high -end Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) \n(Motek Medical, The Netherlands), one of the most advanced biomechanical and virtual reality training labs, will be \nused to effectively train postural control, using interactive environments within a virtual dome. It also comprises an \ninstrumented dual -belt treadmill mounted on a movable platform and 18 VICON cameras for high resolution 3D \nmovement analysis. Beyond the behavioral changes, interventions in children with DCD can modulate brain activity, \nmeasurable with f unctional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) while performing balance tasks. By using our \npersonalized intervention protocol in combination with fNIRS measurements, we aim at providing novel insights both \non neurophysiological processes and the potential n europlastic changes after an intervention in children with DCD. \nFurther, we will examine whether any beneficial change in postural control is related to underlying modifications  in \ncortical activity.  \n \nMethods: Children with DCD (age 7 -12) will be assessed 10 weeks prior to intervention (T0), pre - (T1) and post -\ninterventional (T2), including a 10 -week follow -up (T3). The children receive a 10 -week intervention on the CAREN \nwith two 45 -minute sessions per week. The protocol consists of 7 presele cted games where in each session the games \nare selected by the therapist, using the individual postural control profile, with increasing difficulty level. Postural \ncontrol will be measured with the  Balance Evaluation System Test for children (Kids -BESTest) . Moreover, during six \ntasks from the Kids -BESTest cortical activation will be recorded using NIRSport 2 (NIRx Medical Technologies, \nBerlin, Germany). The fNIRS cap configuration has been chosen to probe three regions of interest: supplementary \nmotor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC) and inferior/ superior parietal lobule (IPL/SPL). The pre -processing of the \nfNIRS signal will be performed using the HomER3 package. Due to the nature of the six Kids -BESTest tasks, \nvariability is present in the duration of the  repetitions and tasks. Therefore, an a lgorithm  recently developed by our \ngroup will be used to time -normalize the data.  \n \nConclusion:  This intervention protocol introduces a new type of individually -tailored intervention providing novel \ninsights regardin g changes in brain activity after a postural control intervention in school -aged children with DCD.  80 of 398",
    "Prefrontalcortical activationswhenlearning irregular\nfeatures inwordsand person\nYaniQiu, Jo Taylor,Paul Burgess\nUniversity College London, Gower Street, London,\nPresenting Author email address: ucjtyqi@ucl.ac.uk\nAbstract: Every word and person are unique, often displaying features that differ from the\nmajority of others (irregular features). Learning irregular features is crucial but challenging.\nInhibition, supported by the prefrontal cortex, is important for such learning in words (Qiu et al.,\n2023). However, it is unclear whether same prefrontal regions support irregularity learning across\ndomains (word, person). Our study involves 35 adults learning regular and irregular features in\nwords and person across five sessions, with fNIRS recording prefrontal cortical activations.\nAnalyses will uncover neural substrates of irregularity learning in word and person domains, and\nhow the activations change over sessions.\nIntroduction: The world is structured with statistical regularities. For example, letters correspond to sounds in\nwords (Siegelman et al., 2020). People’s facial characteristics indicate their ages (Rhodes, 2009). We use knowledge\nof regularities to predict for new words and person (Friston, 2010). However, some words and person do not\nconform to regular patterns. Predictions are therefore erroneous, and item-specific irregular representations must be\nlearned instead (e.g., Dyson et al., 2017). No research has delved into neural mechanisms underlying the learning of\nirregular features in words and person. The present study aims to fill in the gap by investigating 1) what regions in\nthe prefrontal cortex are activated when learning irregular features in words and person respectively, 2) whether the\nactivations are domain-general or domain-specific, and 3) how the activations change over the course of learning.\nMethods: Thirty-five right-handed healthy native English-speaking adults will take part in this study. In the word\ntask, they will see 12 pseudo-words, read them aloud, hear and learn the correct pronunciations. In the person task,\nthey will see 12 unfamiliar faces, say age groups aloud (young, middle-aged, or older adult), hear and learn the\ncorrect age groups. In both tasks, regularity of items will be manipulated (whether predictions based on regular\nletter-sound or face-age correspondences generate correct responses), such that six items are regular and six are\nirregular. To maximally engage participants in learning and avoid use of alternative strategies, items will be learned\nin irregularity-dominant blocks (5 irregular and 1 regular items) and regularity-dominant blocks (5 regular and 1\nirregular items). Learning will be repeated for five times (five learning sessions), during which behavioral (accuracy,\nreaction tim e) and neural data will be collected. With the Hitachi ETG-4000 system, 17 sources and 16 detectors (52\nchannels) will cover the prefrontal cortex. Preprocessed oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin signals will be combined into\nactivation signals (Cui et al., 2010). Activations during irregularity- and regularity-dominant blocks will be\ncompared for both word and person tasks. This will allow us to decide what prefrontal cortical regions are recruited\nin irregularity learning in word, person, and both domains. We will also analyse how these activations and\nbehavioural measures change over learning sessions.\nResults: In both word and person tasks, we expect an increase in accuracy and/or a decrease in reaction time over\nlearning sessions. Learning in irregularity-dominant blocks, relative to regularity-dominant blocks, should involve\nmore prefrontal cortical activations. The activation patterns might be shared by the word and person tasks, indicating\ndomain-general neural substrates of irregularity learning. Alternatively, separate activation patterns might be found,\nsuggesting domain specificity of irregularity learning. It is also possible that irregularity learning recruits both\ndomain-general and domain-specific neural mechanisms. We predict a decrease in activations over the course of\nlearning.\nConclusion: The current study will advance understandings of spatial and temporal characteristics of prefrontal\ncortical activations during learning of irregular features in words and person. It will inform theoretical frameworks\nof word learning and person identity learning.\n81 of 398",
    "Multimodal Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and 9.4T MRI \nshows reduced perfusion and abnormal oxidative \nmetabolism in the EAE mouse model of MS \n \nMada Hashem, A. Max Hamilton, Jeff F. Dunn  \n \nDepartment of Radiology, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Experimental Imaging Centre, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta, \nCanada   \nPresenting Author email address: mada.hashem@ucalgary.ca  \n \nAbstract:  While multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically considered a white matter disease, there is \nprominent evidence that gray matter pathology, such as hypoxia, disruptions in metabolic rate and \nmitochondrial dysfunction are involved as well. We are applying a novel multimodal technique \ncombining near -infrared spectroscopy and high -field MRI to study the mitochondrial status as well \nas oxygen delivery and consumption in the cortex of the EAE mouse model of MS. Reduced \nperfusion, and consequent hypoxia, with abnormal mitochondrial regulation and no change in \nconsumption rate were found in EAE mice. Hypoxia and mitochondrial damage are likely to \nexacerbate the pathology in MS.   \n \nIntroduction:  Inflammation and degeneration of the central nervous system  play an important role in multiple \nsclerosis (MS) and are associated with disease progression, physical d isability, and cognitive impairment. While MS \nis typically considered a white matter disease, there is prominent evidence that gray matter (GM) pathology, such as \nGM hypoxia, disruptions in metabolic rate and mitochondrial dysfunction can be involved in MS  as well. It is \nimportant to understand the mechanisms underlying these disruptions, as abnormal oxidative metabolism in GM may \nexacerbate the pathology of MS. For this, we investigate oxidative metabolism in vivo  in the EAE mouse model, which \nis commonly used as an inflammation induced autoimmunity mouse model of MS.  We combined Near -Infrared \nSpectroscopy (NIRS) with a 9.4T MRI to simultaneously monitor cerebral oxygenation (S tO2), cerebral blood flow \n(CBF), and m etabolic rate for oxygen consumption (CMRO 2) in the cortex of the mouse model. Mitochondrial \nfunction was assessed as well by quantifying the total content and the oxidation state of the mitochondrial enzyme \ncytochrome c oxidase (CCO), which is responsible  for the majority of oxygen consumption in the cell.  \nMethods: Forty -six C57BL/6J female mice were separated into naïve control (n = 16), CFA/PTX control (n = 16) and \nEAE (n = 14) groups. Naïve mice did not receive any injections. CFA/PTX mice were injected  with complete Freund’s \nadjuvant (CFA) and pertussis toxin (PTX). EAE mice were injected with MOG35 -55 peptide emulsified in CFA and \nPTX. NIRS -MRI imaging were performed for all groups at approximately peak disease  (15-18 days post induction ). \nDuring imaging, the mice were spontaneously ventilated with a gas mixture of 70% N 2 and 30% O 2 in addition to 2% \nisoflurane.  A  custom -built broadband NIRS device and in -house developed processing algorithms  were used to \nmeasure and quantify the concentration of h emoglobin and S tO2 in mouse cortex, in addition to the concentration and \noxidation state of CCO . A 9.4T MRI with a 35 mm volume coil was used to measure perfusion via arterial spin labeling \n(ASL) . CBF was calculated on a voxel -by-voxel basis from an ROI in  the cortex.  CMRO 2 was calculated based on \nthe modified Fick principle.  \nResults: At peak -disease, CMRO 2 did not change in EAE and CFA/PTX mice, compared to naïve controls. However, \na significant decrease in CBF  and S tO2 were observed  both in EAE and CFA/PTX  (p < 0.01) . This would support the \nidea that perfusion changes are due to the inflammatory effects on blood flow regulation, caused by the adjuvant and \npertussis toxin. The concentration of CCO was significantly lower in EAE mice c ompared to naïve (p = 0.0 01) and to \nCFA/PTX (p = 0.01). There was no difference between the naïve and CFA/PTX control groups (p = 0. 5). The fact that \nCMRO 2 didn’t change in the EAE indicates that oxygen flux through CCO remained  constant even though total CCO \ncontent decreased. It is possible that increased CCO oxidation state is an adaptation to maintain metabolic rate when \nmitochondria are damaged.  \nConclusion:  We were able to detect significant metabolic alterations in the EAE mouse model of MS  and the \nCFA/PTX control  using novel NIRS -MRI multimodality system. Reduced oxygen supply with no change in the \nmetabolic rate for oxygen consumption could lead to hypoxia —as noted by the reduced S tO2. We suggest that hypoxia \nand r educed perfusion are cause d by inflammation , as they are  in both conditions . In addition, there appears to be \nabnormal mitochondrial regulation  in EAE . Hypoxia and mitochondrial damage are likely to exacerbate the pathology \nin MS.  82 of 398",

Therefore, the \nauthor proposes to construct a diagnostic model of dyslexia by combining the comprehensive \nindicators of brain imaging examination  and cognitive measurement. The results show that the \ndyslexia prediction model constructed by integrating cognitive assessment and multi -modal brain \nimaging data has high discrimination and calibration, and can effectively distinguish high -risk \nchildren with dyslexia.   \n \nIntroduction:  This study aims to explore the specific characteristics of children with dyslexia from perspective of \ncognition and brain function,  and to construct a dyslexia risk prediction model based on “brain -cognition”, providing \na powerful help for clinical diagnosis.  \n \nMethods: Firstly , the cognitive and brain activation features of children with dyslexia were analyzed. A case -control \nstudy was conducted, selecting 51 children that were diagnosed with dyslexia , matched with 47 typically developed \nchildren based on gender and age. The intelligence structure of two groups was evaluated , and the behavioral data \nincluding accuracy and reaction time under tasks of phonological awareness and orthographic awareness were \ncollected. The hemodynamic changes of all channels and brain regions were collected using functional near -infrared \nspectros copy (fNIRS).  Second ly, a dyslexia prediction model based on “brain -cognition” was established. The LASSO \nregression was used to screen the brain functional features with the most predictive value for dyslexia . The diagnosis \nand prediction model of dyslexia was constructed through single -factor and multi -factor logistic regression . \n \nResults: The scores of children with dyslexia in total intelligence quotient, verbal comprehension index, perceptual \nreasoning index, working memory index, and processing speed index were significantly lower than those of typically \ndeveloped children ( P<0.05). In the phonological awareness task, except for the accuracy of finals condition, there \nwere significant differences in the accuracy and reaction time between the dyslexic group and the typically developed \ngroup in the different conditions of the ph onological awareness task ( P<0.05). In the orthographic awareness tasks, \nthere were significant differences between the dyslexic group and the typically developed group in the reaction time \nin the stroke condition and in the correct rate in all conditions ( P<0.05). In the phonological awareness task, the brain \nactivation level of children with dyslexia was lower than that of typically developed children, and the channels with \nsignificant activation differences were: channel 6, 11, 15, 18, 20, 22, 38 and 40 (P<0.05). Compared with typically \ndeveloped children, children with dyslexia had significantly lower activation in the regions of interest (ROI) in left \nBroca's area, superior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. LASSO regression analysis showed that the \nactivation level of the left Broca's area was the most significant brain imaging indicator for predicting dyslexia. Single -\nfactor and multi -factor logistic regression analysis showed that perceptual reasoning index , working memory index, \naccuracy of the orthographic awareness task, and activation level of the left Broca's area were effective predictive \nfactors ( P<0.05). The diagnostic predictive model based on effective predictive factors had an AUC of 0.915 (95% \nCI: 0.872 -0.976), the sensitivity was 90.9%, and the specificity was 80.5%. The calibration curve showed good \nconsistency between the predicted results a nd the actual results of the model, and the Hosmer -Lemeshow goodness -\nof-fit test shows no statistical difference ( P=0.942), indicating no deviation from the ideal model. The average AUC \nvalue of 5 -fold cross validation is 0.911, and the AUC value of each fold is above 0.8.   \n \nConclusion:  Children with dyslexia have specific characteristics in cognitive structure, language cognitive processing, \nand brain activation in phonological awareness tasks, which may be potential biological markers of dyslexia. The \ndyslexia prediction model construct ed by integrating cognitive assessment and multi -modal brain imaging data has \nhigh discrimination and calibration, and can effectively distinguish high -risk children with dyslexia.  83 of 398",
    "Fronto-parietal cortical activation during balance tasks in \nchildren with Developmental Coordination Disorder – \nPreliminary results  \n \nMaja Van Grinderbeek1, Anna Falivene2, Charlotte Johnson1,3, Pieter Meyns1, Ann \nHallemans3, Emilia Biffi2, Caterina Piazza2, Alessandro Crippa2, Evi Verbecque1, Katrijn \nKlingels1 \n \n1Rehabilitation Research Centre - REVAL, Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium . ² Scientific Institute, \nIRCCS Eugenio Medea – Ass. La Nostra Famiglia, Bosisio Parini (LC), Italy . ³ Research group MOVANT,  Department of Rehabilitation \nSciences and Physiotherapy , University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium   \nMaja.vangrinderbeek@uhasselt.be  \n \nAbstract:  Balance problems are prevalent in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder. \nHowever, the underlying brain control mechanisms still need  to be unravelled. Cortical activity in \nthe fronto -parietal regions can be investigated during balance tasks w ith functional Near -Infrared \nSpectr oscopy (fNIRS) . This  can offer crucial insights to disentangle the origin of the balance \ndifficulties. Four DCD and four TD children performed three balance tasks while undergoing fNIRS. \nAcross participants, an increase of the mean hemodynamic response function  relative to the HbO 2 \nconcentration was observed at task onse t with an opposite trend for the HbR responses . Further \nanalysis with larger sample sizes are needed.   \n \nIntroduction:  Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a  neurodevelopmental condition with a prevalence of \n5-6% in school -aged children. It is characterized by a delay in the acquisition of coordinated motor skills with a \nsignificant influence on daily life. Up to 60 -87% of the children with DCD experience bala nce problems with a large \nheterogeneity in the manifestation of these problems. However , the origin of these problems, namely  the underlying \nbrain control mechanisms, still needs to be unravelled. Functional brain -imaging during balance tasks can offer cru cial \ninsights to disentangle the origin of the balance difficulties. The goal of the present work is to investigate the cortical \nactivity in fronto -parietal regions with functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) during different balance tasks . \n \nMethods: Children with (probable) DCD and typical developing (TD) children between the age of 8 and 10 years \nwere included. All participants performed three balance tasks of the Balance Evaluation Systems Test for children \n(Kids -BESTest ) in a standardized order while undergoing fNIRS: alternate stair touching (5 repetitions), leaning (5 \nrepetitions) and walking test (6 repetitions). The fNIRS data was recorded using the NIRSport 2 (NIRx Medical \nTechnologies, Berlin, Germany). Specific ch annels were chosen to probe three regions of interest (supplementary \nmotor area , premotor cortex, inferior/superior parietal lobule). Changes in blood oxygenation were measured in terms \nof cortical oxyhaemoglobin (Hb O₂), and deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR).  The th ree balance tasks differed in terms of \nnumber of repetitions and total durations. To overcome this issue, we have recently developed a specific algorithm to \ntime-normalize the data.  \n \nResults: Preliminary data was acquired in eight children, four with DCD (mean age 9.78 ± 0.30, 3 males) and four \nTD children (mean age 9.02 ± 0.30, 2 males) . Across participants, an increase of the mean HRF relative to the HbO 2 \nconcentration was observed at task onset, which was more pronounced in the leaning and walking task. Conversely, \na decrease in the HRF can be observed in the post -task period, which can be considered as a resting phase with lowered \nbrain activation. Inter estingly, an opposite trend was observed for the HbR responses. Lastly, based on qualitative \nanalysis, TD children showed higher mean HbO 2 concentrations than children with DCD, especially during the lean \nand walking task.   \n \nConclusion:  Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy can be effectively used in children to investigate cortical activity \nwhile performing balance tasks. Task -dependent differences in HRF can be observed between the onset and end of a \ntask. Higher activation during balan ce tasks seems to be present in children with TD as opposed to children with DCD; \nhowever, further analyses with larger sample size are needed.   \n 84 of 398",
    "A Multi-Atlas Machine Learning Approach for Automated \nSegmentation of Widefield Optical Imaging in Mice  \n \nHayden B. Fisher, Aurora Yuan, and Brian R. White \n \nDivision of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. 3401 Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.  \nPresenting Author email address: whiteb1@chop.edu  \n \nAbstract:  In neuroimaging studies, precise brain and non -brain pixel labeling is essential for robust \nprocessing and statistical testing. Traditionally, such segmentation of widefield optical imaging data \nis performed manually, leading to high inter -rater variabilit y. Current state -of-the-art machine \nlearning approaches use a single baseline false -color or fluorescence image  and are not generalizable \nto multi -institutional data. Our  approach maintains data from all illumination wavelengths, using \nconvolutional networ ks for segmentation. Multi -atlas techniques exhibited statistically significant \nimprovements over single -atlas segmentation, showing promising results for efficiency and reduced \nvariability. Future endeavors will refine models and expand datasets for broad er applicability.  \n \nIntroduction:  In neuroimaging studies, robust processing and statistical testing require accurate labeling of brain \nand non -brain pixels. Traditionally, segmentation for widefield optical imaging (WOI) has been performed by hand, \nwherein the boundary of visualized brain is manually traced. These methods require substantial user training and are \nsubject to unintended variation. Machine learning techniques have been introduced but lack generalizability and \nrequire researcher interven tion to correct errors. Unlike prior segmentation methods which use a single baseline \nimage, we propose an approach where data from all illumination wavelengths are maintained and segmented using a \nseries of fully convolutional networks. We aim to demonstr ate that such a strategy mitigates potential error \nassociated with any single -atlas propagation.  \n \nMethods: Images were obtained (1024x1024 pixels) using a custom WOI system with four wavelengths for \nhemodynamic imaging ( 470, 530, 590, and 625 nm). For indi vidual atlas prediction, we used a U -Net architecture \nwith a four -level encoder depth and a weighted binary cross -entropy loss function. Using a ground truth mask \ndefined by expert manual segmentation, U -Net models were trained on baseline images for four  wavelengths. Each \nmodel underwent 200 training iterations using training data from 80 scans and validation data from 15 scans. An \naveraged segmentation was calculated to indicate the pixel -wise agreement across all four masks. A ground truth \nprobability ma trix was multiplied with the combined mask to further refine accuracy of edge boundary predictions. \nFinally, brain and non -brain determinations were made by a  threshold  of 0.6 . For comparison with existing machine \nlearning methods, an additional model was trained using a baseline false color image.  \n \nResults: Multi-atlas methods resulted in statistically significant improvements in accuracy against any single \nwavelength segmentation. Our approach yielded median Dice and Jaccard scores of 89.52% and 81.03%, \nrespectively, and showed an average absolute improvement  of 13% for Dice, and 19% for Jaccard compared to prior \nart. A Wilcoxon signed -rank test confirm ed a statistically significant difference between segmentation predictions \nusing single -atlas methods and the proposed multi -atlas method  (p<0.001) . \n \nConclusion:  Our multi -atlas technique holds substantial promise for enhancing data -processing efficiency and \nreducing inter -rater variability. Future work will involve further refinement of models and expansion of datasets to \ninclude multi -institutional da ta and calcium -fluorescence imaging.    \nFigure: Example  of manual  (colored contour) , false -color, and multi -atlas methods of segmentation.  \n85 of 398",
    "Illumind: A n Accessible, Flexible  Graphical User Interface \nfor Hemodynamic and Fluorescent  Widefield Imaging  \n \nBenjamin N. Zelnick, Ananya Paladugu, Hayden B. Fisher, and Brian R. White \n \nDivision of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia  and the Perelman School of Medicine at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania . 3401 Civic Center Blvd , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA . \nPresenting Author email address : whiteb1@chop.edu  \n \nAbstract:  In order to make widefield optical imaging (WOI) accessible to a wide range of \nneuroscience laboratories, acquisition software must become user -friendly. We have replaced \nvendor -specific interfaces and the MATLAB comman d line with an integrated graphic al user \ninterface, termed Illumind . This program integrates with hardware to automatically determine \nsystem capabilities. Hemodynamic and fluorescence imaging are easily performed with automated \ncalibration and error handling. Illumind reduces the  training  needed  prior to performing  WOI \nimaging. Modularity allows for integration of new camera hardware and fluorophores. Standardized \nmetadata with JSON files enables streamlined integration with flexible processing.  \n \nIntroduction:  Widefield optical imaging (WOI) is a  powerful  method for mouse  functional  neuroimaging that imag es \nthe mouse cortex with high temporal resolution and hemodynamic and fluorescent contrasts. WOI can bridge between \nmouse models of disease and human translational neuroimaging (functional near infrared spectroscopy or magnetic \nresonance imaging). Wider uptake of WOI by the mouse neuroscience community is limited by a lack of standardized \noff-the-shelf hardware and software which makes integrating novel methods into an existing la boratory research \nscheme more complex . Prior open -source software ha s been focused on the priorities of the originat ing laborator ies \nand lack flexible, modular architecture s. We aimed to address some of these barriers through Illumind , which  provide s \na use r-friendly graphical interface for  WOI, accessible to non -imaging scientists  and adaptable to individual \nlaboratory’s needs (e.g., hemodynamics and/or genetically -encoded calcium or voltage indicators : GECIs, GEVIs).  \n \nMethods: Illumind  was developed using MATLAB ’s interface development API.  It is currently integrated with \nThorlabs LED drivers, such that installed LED wavelengths and serial numbers are automatically detected. It is also \nintegrated with Andor’s SDK for acquisition via  a Zyla camera. Illumination and filtering requirements are stored in \nJSON files such that Illumind can automatically determine which acquisition modes are supported by detected \nhardware. Acquisition parameters (e.g., frame rate, duty cycle, camera binning) ar e similarly stored in JSON files with \noptions for modification  by advanced users. Color -coded buttons and indicators are used to guide users through scan s \nwith automated error checking. Acquisitions were demonstrated on wild -type C57bl/6 mice and Thy1 -GCaM P mice \non a C57bl/6 background  (using ketamine -xylazine anesthesia) . All protocols were approved by the IACUC  at CHOP . \n \nResults: Members of our laboratory and \ncollaborating laboratories have been trained on \nIllumind, which has simplified the prior \nacquisition pipeline. Both hemodynamic and \nGCaMP WOI ha ve been collected. Illumind is \nopen -source and available on GitH ub, where bug \nreports and feature requests can be submitted.  \n \nConclusion:  Illumind simplifies the training \nneeded for WOI image acquisition . Paired with \nopen -source hardware , this should allow \ndissemination of WOI to the wider mouse \nneuroscience community. Future versions will \nallow for additional GECIs/GEVIs and camera \nmanufactures (though the use of GenTL \nstandards). Illumind’s flexible architecture will \nallow streamlined integration of new \nillumination and acquisition hardware.   \nFigure: (A) Software schematic with prior art in black arrows \nand new hardware/software integration in red arrows.

Yücelñ, David A. Boasñ, Alexander von Lühmann1,2,3,* \n¹ Intelligent Biomedical Sensing (IBS) Lab, Technische Universität Berlin, 10587 Berlin, Germany  \n² BIFOLD – Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data, 10587 Berlin, Germany  \n³ Neurophotonics Center, Biomedical Engineering, Boston University,  Boston, MA 02215, USA  \nemail: middell@tu -berlin.de , vonluehmann@tu -berlin.de   \nAbstract:  We would like to announce the release of a new Python -based software framework, \nCedalion, designed for data -driven fNIRS/DOT analysis, with the ultimate goal of merging well -\nestablished analysis methods for neuroimaging modalites (e.g. fNIRS, EEG) and phys iological \nand behavioral measurements, with advanced multimodal machine learning techniques.  \nIntroduction: fNIRS / DOT signal s are inherently confounded by systemic physiological  activity  in the cerebral and \nextra -cerebral compartments . As a result, contrast, sensitivity, and specificity of the recovered hemodynamic \nresponse s are affected  – a problem that is further amplified by natural behavior in experiments for neuroscience in \nthe everyday world [1].  This motivates  our research into new methods that make use of additional auxiliary \nmeasurements from physiological sensors and complementary neuroimaging modalities like EEG to explain \nvariance in fNIRS  signals and separate confounding components from those of interest . However, complex  \nproperties  such as non -stationarities, non -instantaneous and non -linear coupling between the multimodal and \nmultivariate time  series make modelling the relationships betw een different signals  a hard problem . A promising \napproach is learning these relationships from data  with machine learning and AI. As we  assume that these methods \nwill play an increasing role in the upcoming years , we are developing Cedalion, a new Python -based framework , to \naid the community in  combining state of the art fNIRS/DOT methods with ML/AI . Towards  improv ing contrast and \nstatistical power in neuroimaging  experiments,  boost ing performance in single trial analysis for BCI and \nNeuroergonomics and uncover ing complex relationships between systemic physiology and the embodied brain [ 2]. \nMethods: Cedalion  is a modular and open -source Python package that combines much of the key functionality of \nHOMER2/3 and AtlasViewer with the rich Python ecosystem of machine learning and data science tools for data -\ndriven analysis using packages such  as sklearn, PyTorch and Pandas . Our goal is 1) to facilitate the development of \nnew data-driven methods , by simplifying \nthe integration of machine learning \nworkflows and conventional fNIRS data \nprocessing streams.  2) to provide user -\nextensible data structures and func tionality \nthat allow for easy data exchange with \npopular frameworks, and with  established \ntoolboxes  through standardized file formats \nlike SNIRF and BIDS . 3) to support the \nconstruction of workflows that chain \nexisting functionality of versatile and well -\ntested analysis toolboxes that provide \nspecific preprocessing methods for each \nneuroimaging modality.  4) to establish a \ncommunity -centered  development philosophy  that focuses on easy contribution  and distribution of new methods and \nclearly credit s contributors and incorporated published work on its documentation page. Currently , Cedalion’s \nfunctionality comprises photogrammetric optode coregistration, standard signal pre -processing (channel quality \nassessment, artifact rejection, filtering, mBLL conversion), General Linear Model  analysis , integration of MCX  for \nphoton simulation, DOT image reconstruction , and first pipeli nes for ML -based single -trial analysis.  \nResults and Conclusion : Cedalion is a n ongoing development project (see ibs-lab.com/cedalion ) and openly \navailable on github.com/ibs -lab/cedalion .  \nAcknowledgement: The IBS Lab  gratefully acknowledge s support from BMBF BIFOLD2 4B. \nReferences:  [1] A. von Lühmann et al. , “Toward Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW) using functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy,” Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering , vol. 18, p. 100272, Jun. 2021, doi: 10.1016/j.cobme.2021 .100272 . \n[2] F.

To understand the neural basis of natural speech processing we used \nhigh-density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT) to measure regional b rain response while \nparticipants watch ed a movie clip. Individual word onsets were modeled in a general linear model \nframework to identify responses to auditory -only and audiovisual speech. In Experiment 1, we \nidentify modality -dependent response s to language from movie viewing in normal -hearing adults. \nIn Experiment 2, we show differences in speech processing between listeners with cochlear implants \nand those with normal hearing.  \n \nIntroduction:  Human interaction involves communicating in busy environments, conversations that provide context, \nand the ability to see a talker’s mouth while they speak. However, many of these are missing from laboratory studies \nof speech processing. The goal of the current study is to better understand \neveryday communication using a movie, which mimics  many of the same \ncues found in natural environments.  \n \nMethods: In both experiments, participants viewed ~10 minutes from  the \nmovie  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  (1966). Their only task was to \nwatch attentively. Word onsets for auditory -only and audiovisual speech \nwere manually determined and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic \nresponse function for statistical analysis. Experiment  1 examined \nresponses to auditory -only and audiovisual speech in a publicly available \ndata set[1] containing  data from  58 adults. Experiment 2 compared \nresponses between a group of 18 adults with a cochlear implant and a \ngroup of  18 controls with normal hearing. Processing was done using a \ncombination of NeuroDOT  and SPM12.  \n \nResults: In Exp . 1 we identified robust responses to both auditory -only \nand audiovisual speech. In Exp . 2, we show ed how responses differ \nbetween listeners with and without cochlear implants ( Figure 1). \n \nConclusion:  We extracted  modality -dependent responses to spoken \nlanguage from naturalistic stimuli using HD -DOT. Furthermore, we \nshow how listeners with cochlear implants rely more on the dorsolateral \nprefrontal cortex (DLPFC)  during spoken language processing than \nlisteners with normal hearing. These findings provide important steps in \nunderstanding the neuroscience underlying everyday experience.  \n \nReferences  \n1. Sherafati, A. et al.

FPN connectivity was assessed, using fNIRS, among 4 - and 5 -year-old children at high and \nlow familial risk for ADHD. Increased connectivity  between the prefrontal cortex  and posterior \nparietal  appears to be  necessary to sustained attention for young children likely to develop ADHD.   \n \nIntroduction:  ADHD  is a common neurodevelopmental disorder  with significant life time impairment . Identification \nof and intervention targeting attention -supporting neural networks during preschool, a sensitive period of brain \ndevelopment, may improve outcomes for children with ADHD.  This project aimed to compare frontoparietal network \n(FPN) connectivity among preschool -aged children at high and low familial risk for ADHD.  \n \nMethods: Forty -six preschool aged children , 21 high risk  (HR)  for ADHD  due to a parent with ADHD, completed \nfNIRS assessments at age 4 and 5  years old during a low cognitive load ta sk, and the Conn ers Performance Task .  \n \nResults: HR 4 -year-olds had increased bilateral PFC activation (t=2.30, p=0.03, q=0.74) and more activity between \nRt prefrontal cortex and Lt Parietal (t=2.76, p<0.01, q=0.74) and regions of the Dorsal Attention Network ( DAN ; \nt=2.54, p=0.02, q=0.74; Figure 1a). Greater connectivity between the Rt PFC and Lt Parietal (t=2.46, p=0.02, q=0.13) \nand decreased in regions of the DAN (t= -2.62, p=0.014, q=0.10) at age 4 are associated with more ADHD symptoms \nat age 5 (Figure 1b). At age 5, inattention  (greater reaction time variability)  is associated with less connectivity \nbetween the Rt PFC and  Rt Parietal (t= -3.24, p<0.01, q=0.03; Figure 1c). \n \nConclusion:  Increased connectivity  between the prefrontal cortex  and posterior parietal  appears to be  necessary to \nsustained attention for young children at risk for ADHD and may serve as an early neural maker of risk and target for \nprevention interventions.  \n \nAcknowledgements: Brain Behavior Research Foundation  NARSAD Young Investigator Award  \nReferences:  (1) Anderson PJ, Reidy N.

Minimizing the effects of \nCA on the brain  requires quantitative real-time bedside monitor ing of the cerebral status.  We apply \na coherent hemodynamic spectroscopy model to cerebral hemodynamic  data from  a pig model of \nthe cardiac arrest , which allows for recovering various microvascular and metabolic parameters of \nthe brain.  This provides  valuable knowledge of the impact of CA  on the brain and  ways  to improve \ntreatment.  In the futu re our approach may lead to a clinical  non-invasive technique  for measuring \nmicrovascular and metabolic parameters in CA patients.  \n \nIntroduction:  On average one out of 1,000 peop le suffers cardiac arrest (CA)  during life time . Minimizing the effects \nof CA on  the brain is one of the major goals of the intra - and post -CA treatments. Various cardio -pulmonary \nresuscitation  (CPR)  techniques and medications are currently being investigated to achieve that goal. To accurately \nassess treatment effects it is ne cessary to develop real -time bedside neuroimaging techniques and quantitative \nmeasures of the cerebral status.  Quantitative h emometabolic models play crucial role in comprehending and \ninterpreting  cerebral  data measured by  imaging techniques.  In this study  we apply  the non -linear coherent \nhemodynamic spectroscopy (CHS) model [ 1] to the near-infrared spectroscopy and cerebral blood flow measure ments  \nto monitor  cerebral microvascular and metabolic parameters . \n \nMethods: CA was induced  in pigs  for 2 minutes by applying the 10 mV 300 Hz  pacing  via a catheter introduced into \nthe right hear ventricle . NIRS optodes were  positioned on the dura mater through the holes drilled in the skull , \nmaintaining the inter -optode spacing of 20 mm. A custom -made NIRS system with a highly sensitive spectrometer \nrecorded data in the 700 -1000 nm range. The h yperspectral NIRS algorithm was used to determine changes in the \ncerebral HbO 2, HHb, and rCCO concentrations . To measure the cerebral blood flo w (CBF ) a laser Doppler probe was \ninserted through the burr hole and affixed atop intact cortical dura.  We developed a custom  algorithm , which  applied \nthe HbO 2, HHb, and CBF data to the  non-linear CHS  model . This algorithm  recovered  the values of the rate of oxygen \ndiffusion from blood to tissue , Fåhraeus factor, capillary, arterial and venous volume fractions , cerebral metabolic rate \nof oxygen , and other mi crovascular parameters during the baseline , CA, CPR, and after the return to spontaneous \ncirculation.  \n \nResults: The non -liner CHS model could well explain  (fit) the observed changes in most  of experiment . By inverting \nthe CHS model, we measured a range of significant physiological parameters .  Most of the measured parameter s were \nin agreement with the known values, validating our methodology and reinforcing result accuracy. The statistical \nanalysis revealed sign ificant variations between their baseline intra-, and post - CA values for the Fåhraeus factor  and \nthe a verage hemoglobi n concentration in the blood .  \n \nConclusion:  Non-linear CHS model applied to the invasively ob tained hemodynamic data well explains the measured \nchanges  and a llows for recovering  various  microvascular and  metabolic parameters of the brain. Our approach  allow s \nfor gaining valuable knowledge of the impact of CA, CPR and medications on the brain and  ways  to improve the \neffectiveness of CPR.  In the future our approach may lead to the development of a clinical  technique  where  non-\ninvasive  NIRS and diffu se correlation  spectroscopy will b e used to  measure the he modynamic  and CBF changes and \nto recover the  microva scular and metabolic parameters  of CA patients . \n \n1.

UC  Berkeley  \nPresenting Author email address: yuanygao@stanford.edu  \n \nAbstract:  We examined the association between early -life OP pesticide exposure and fNIRS -\nmeasured functional connectivity in 291 Mexican American  adolescents.  Results indicated that  \nadolescent males with elevated childhood OP pesticide exposure may have altered brain regional \nconnectivity  between  the right interior frontal and premotor cortex. This altered neurofunctional \npattern may partially mediate working memory impairment associated with childhood DAP \nexposure.  \n \nIntroduction:  Previous research  has indicated link s between  early life exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides \nand adverse neurodevelopment and task-elicited  neural activation  in adolescents1,2. In a follow -up study , we \ninvestigate d the impact of early life OP pesticide exposure s on functional connectivity in adolescents.  \nMethods: Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was administered to 291 young adults participating  in the \nCenter for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study, a longitudinal study of \nwomen recruited during pregnancy and their offspring. Prenatal and childhood dialkylphosphates  (DAPs ) were \nmeasured  in urinary samples collected from mothers during pregnancy (13 and 26 weeks) and from children during  \nearly life (at ages 6 months, 1, 2, 3, and 5 years). Youth underwent fNIRS while they performed executive function \nand semantic language tasks during their 18 -year-old visit. Covariate -adjusted regression models were utilized to \nestimate associations between  prenatal and childhood DAP levels and  functional connectivity among  the frontal, \ntemporal, and parietal regions . Additionally,  a mediation model was employed to  investigate  the role of functional \nconnectivity in mediating the relationship between DAPs and task performance.  \nResults: In the overall sample,  null associations were observed between prenatal or  childhood DAP concentrations \nand functional connectivity. However, upon  examining  sex differences, an association was found between childhood \nDAPs and functional connectivity for the right interior frontal and premotor cortex among males  (n=77, [β]=0.333, \n95% CI=(0.16, 0.50), p (FDR -corrected)=0.026 ) (Fig. A -B), but not females. Furthermore , functional connectivity \nappeared to mediate an inverse association between DAPs and working memory accuracy among males  (Fig. C) . \nConclusion:  In CHAMACOS, we found that adolescent males with elevated childhood OP pesticide exposure had \naltered brain regional connectivity. This altered neurofunctional pattern in males may partially mediate working \nmemory impairment associated with childhood DAP exposure.  \n \nFigure 1 (A) Visualization of the positions of the right premotor/somatosensory cortex and interior frontal pole (blue dots) and the c onnectivity between \nthe two (red line) on the cortex.

Swine infused with rotenone to in hibit \nmitochondrial  Complex I were treated with  a novel succinate prodrug or placebo.  An invasive \nmicrodialysis lactate -pyruvate ratio (LPR) metric of m etabolism wa s also acquired . No changes in  \noxCCO  or OEF  were observed in the placebo group . In the treatment group, increased  oxCCO and \ndecreased OEF  were observed , and these changes correlated with increased LPR.  Results  suggest  \noxCCO and OEF are sen sitive to mitochondrial impairment  during non -ischemic conditions . \n \nIntroduction : Hybrid broadband and frequency -domain diffuse optical spe ctroscopy measurements  of oxidized \ncytochrome -c-oxidase (oxCCO)  and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)  hold promise for assessing brain metabolism . \nPrior work has largely focused on the optical detection of impaired metabolism caused by cerebral hypoxia and \nischemia. Hypoxia and ischemia are important causes of metabolic failure, but  other  failure causes exist.  \nMitochondrial C omplex I dysfunction  commonly occurs during non -ischemic conditions , for example, in patients \nwith Parkinson’s disease . Here w e aim to determine whether optical oxCCO and OEF metrics are assoc iated with \nmetabolic impairments caused by complex I dysfunction  in swine . We further aim to use the metrics to evaluate the \nefficacy of a novel succinate prodrug  for treating complex I dysf unctio n.1,2 Optical findings were supported with \ninvasive cerebral microdialysis measurements of lactate -pyruvate ratio (LPR). We hypothesize d that rotenone -\ninduced complex I dysfunction  in swine  will increase oxCCO  and LPR,  and decreas e OEF. We then considered  \nprodrug  treatment  to be effective if it reduced  these changes.   \nMethods:  Fifteen Yorkshire swine were divided into a control group (n = 5) and two infusion groups. One group \nreceived rotenone (0.1 mg/kg/hr) and placebo (100 mg/kg/hr) (n =5) while the other received rotenone (0.1 \nmg/kg/hr) and succinate prodrug (100 mg/kg/hr) (n =5) . Over a 4 -hour monitoring period, h ybrid  diffuse  optical \nmonitoring  was performed  concurrently with  microdialysis  sampling  of LPR and blood gas sampling of systemic \nlactate . For the optical monitoring, broadband spectra were calibrated with frequency -domain spectroscopy  \nmeasurements to obtain OEF, ΔoxCCO ( differ ential change in oxCCO from pre-infusion baseline) , and ΔHbT \n(differential change in total hemoglobin concentration from pre -infusion baseline).  Changes  in measured parameters \nover time  for each experimental group  were assessed using linear mixed effects model s. \nResults and Discussion:  There were no temporal changes in the co ntrol group.  In the rotenone+placebo  group, modest \nincreases in LPR (p=0.02) and HbT (p<0.01) were observed, but  oxCCO  (p=0.15) , OEF  (p=0.32) , and systemic lactate \n(p = 0.06)  remained constant . Contrary to expectations,  there were more substantial changes in the rotenone+prod rug \ngroup;  oxCCO, LPR , systemic lactate  and HbT all increased  (p<0.01)  while  OEF  decreased (p<0.01) . Thus, optical \noxCCO  and OEF metrics are sensitive to the increased degree of  mitochondrial impairment  associated with prodrug \n(i.e., as confirmed by the highly significant LPR and systemic lactate increases) . Possibly, the dosage of prodrug   was \ntoo high for the mild degree of impairment induced by rotenone ; prodrug increases electron flow through Complex II, \nbut if forward flow from Complex I is  only mildly impaired,  excess buildup of electrons in Complex II  could cause  \nreverse electron tran sport from II to I that  triggers formation of damaging  reactive oxygen species.  Ultimately, optical \nassessment of mitochondrial impairment  could be used to  guide  the optimal therapeutic  prodrug dos e. \nReferences  \n(1) Ehinger, J. K.; Piel, S.; et al. Nat.

Attention  to the active muscles during \nexercise may lead to improvements in exercise efficiency and performance . However, the \nhemodynamic effects  of directing attention to active muscles are unclear.  Using diffuse correlation \nspectroscopy, we investigat ed the effect of awareness of active muscles on peripheral \nhemodynamics. Our results demonstrate that motor  awareness  significantly increased active muscle \nblood flow immediately after the onset  of exercise . \n \nIntroduction:  Central command causes autonomic nervous system responses to increase  blood flow to active muscles, \ncontributing to exercise endurance.  The amount of central command varies according to  the effort and the state of \nfatigue  of the individual , regardless of the load or tension being exerted. Directing the attention to the active muscle \nis also hypothesized to increase  the central command . However, little is known about the effect of motor  awareness  \non the peripheral blood flow dynamics  of the targeted muscle , which could have important implications for clinical \npractice. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate  the impact of motor  awareness  on peripheral muscle blood flow dynamics \nusing diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS).  \n \nMethods:  Twelve  healthy right -handed young adults ( 4 males, \naged 21 –24 years) participated in the study.  Participants were \ninstructed to  perform a dynamic handgrip  exercise  for two minutes  \n(10-second contraction, 10 -second relaxation) at 40% of maximum \nvoluntary contraction under two conditions:  a high  awareness  \ncondition in which they performed motor -sensory recall on their \nown movement s (target muscle: flexor digitorum superficialis \nmuscle  of dominant hand) displayed on the monitor, and a low  \naware ness condition in which they did not observe the target \nmuscle and focused on the content of the audio reading to prevent \nmotor -sensory recall  (Figure 1). Blood flow index (BFI), a measure \nof the tissue blood flow in DCS, was measured in the active muscle \nusing our in -house developed DCS system  [1]. The BFI was \nnormalized  to the mean BFI values collected for 60 seconds prior \nto exercise  (rBFI) . All experiments were approved by the \ninstitutional ethics committee and participants gave written \ninformed consent prior to participation.  \n \nResults: After the first contraction, mean rBFI was significantly \nhigher  in the high  awareness  condition  than in the low  awareness  \ncondition (Figure 2 ) (p < 0.05) . \n \nConclusion:  Our results demonstrated that motor awareness \nsignificantly increased blood flow to the active muscle  at the onset  \nof exercise , indicating the potential utility and efficacy of motor \nawareness to improve  peripheral circulation  in clinical settings . \n  \nReference:   \n1.

    "Development of an fNIRS -based neurofeedback system \nusing prefrontal asymmetry  \n \nRyosuke Hiyama *, Tatsuo Hirata , Takumu Yamaguchi, Hiroki Sato  \n \nDepartment of Systems Enginee ring and Science , Graduate Sch ool of Engine ering and S cience, Shibaura Institute of Tech nology  \n307 Fukasaku, Minuma -ku, Saitama -shi, Saitama 307 -8570, JAPAN  \nmf23095@shibaura -it.ac.jp  \n \nAbstract:  Previous studies suggest that “choking under pressure ” in sports is associated with \nasymmetry in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity, with performance being higher during left \nhemisphere dominance. In this study, we aimed to develop a neurofeedback system using function \nnear-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based on this finding. This system was developed using a 2 -\nchannel fNIRS device and smartphone to provide musical feedback on asymmetry in PFC activ ity. \nThe effectiveness of the system was evaluated in a preliminary experiment with six participants and \nthe result s were positive.  \n \nIntroduction:  The decrease in performance due to psychological pressure is defined as “choking under pressure. ” To \nprevent the “choking under pressure, ” neurofeedback (NF) techniques which provide quantitative brain data are \nexpected to be effective. Several neuroimaging studies of “choking under pressure ” have suggested that the choking \neffect is associated with asymmetry in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation, with performance being higher when left \nactivation is dominant [1], [2]. Therefore, we developed a functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based NF \nsystem using asymmetry  in PFC activity, and investigated its effectiveness in adjusting brain a ctivity.  \n \nMethods: The system was developed to provide auditory feedback on asymmetry in the PFC. An fNIRS device (HOT -\n2000, NeU), which measures cortical hemodynamics at two channels in the frontal region, was used to measure brain \nactivity . In addition, a smartphone was used for signal processing. Light intensity data were transmitted via wireless \ncommunication to a smartphone and converted to changes in the total -hemoglobin (HbT) concentration (HbT signal) \nusing a dedicated software develo pment kit (NeU). In every sampling at  0.1 s, the mean HbT signal over the previous \n5 s was calculated, and the Laterality Index (LI) [3] was also obtained using the mean value. The volume of white noise \nin classical music is then changed based on this LI. The LI value was between -1 and 1. The more this value increases \nin the positive direction, the less white noise is produced and the more clearly classical music can be heard.  \nA preliminary experiment was conducted with six male participants (mean age 21.2 ±0.68 years) to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the system in adjusting brain activity . The experiments were conducted for two days, with participants \nperforming one day each of asymmetry adjustment training with correct feedback (NF condition) and one day each \nwith placebo feedback (placebo condition). An analysis of the differences in the LI between the conditions was \nconducted.  \n \nResults: The mean LI of the two conditions (NF condition and placebo condition) was compared  by a paired t-test, \nand we found that the LI in the NF condition was significantly higher than that in the placebo condition (t(5)=2.015, \np=.031, d=0.97, 95%CI[0.21. 1.74]).  \n \nConclusions:  We developed an fNIRS -based neurofeedback system  that uses PFC asymmetry. As a preliminary \nevaluation of this system, six men were trained to adjust the asymmetry to a left -dominant state, demonstrating the \nfeasibility  of modulating the asymmetry of PFC activity. In the future, we plan to conduct replication experiments to \nconfirm whether asymmetry can be modulated in more participants, and further to evaluate the effectiveness of the \nsystem in preventing the choking under pressure.  \n \nReferences:  \n[1] Chen  et al.

    "Prefrontal cortex activity associated with hand dexterity  \n- A Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy Study - \n \nShunpei Toriyama *, Tomoko Fujita, Nozomi Sasaki , Hiroki Sato  \n \nDepartment of Systems Engineering and Science, Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology  \n307 Fukasaku, Minuma -ku, Saitama -shi, Saitama 337 -8570, JAPAN  \n*bn20204 @shibaura -it.ac.jp  \n \nAbstract:  We investigated the association between hand dexterity and prefrontal cortex activity  \nusing functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) . Twenty right -handed adults participa ted in \nexperiments in which  the Purdue Pegboard Test was used to assess  hand dexterity and fNIRS was \nused to measure cortical activation during a pin -manipulation task  requiring dexterity .  \nStatistical analysis  revealed  increased activity in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex during the \npin-manipulation task compared with the  control task. In addition, prefrontal cortex activity during \nthe pin -manipulation task correlate d with hand dexterity scores. These results suggest a relationship \nbetween hand dexterity and prefrontal cortex activity during the pin-manipulation task.  \n \nIntroduction:  Elaborate movements of the human hand are involved in grasping and pinching.  Various  brain regions \nhave been suggested to be  activated in the complex process es of processing, planning, and executing visual \ninformation to perform a series of elaborate hand movements. In a previous study, prefrontal brain activity was \nconfirmed during complex grasping operations, suggesting that the prefrontal cortex is activated during dexterity tasks  \n[1]. However, few studies have experimentally demonstrated a correlation  between hand dexterity and prefrontal \ncortex activity. In this study, we used functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess prefrontal cortex activity \nduring a fine -manipulation task.  \n \nMethods: Twenty right -handed university students (10 males and 10 females, 21.5 ± 0.8 years old) participated  in the \nstudy. The Purdue pegboard test, which is widely used in clinical practice as a hand motor task, was used to assess the \nhand dexterity. The participants performed three tasks with their right and left hands: a simple peg task that required \ndexterity and precise insertion and removal of pegs; an assembly peg task that required intricate assembly of pegs, \nwashers, and other components; and a control task in which they moved only their clenched fists without manipulating \npegs. An fNIRS system (NIRSport2, NIRx) was used to measure cortical hemodynamics  in 44 channels (ch) covering  \nthe frontal and parietal lobes. The oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy -Hb) signal during the 14[s] motor task was converted \nto z-scores and analyzed  to identify activation regions . Correlations between the Purdue pegboard score  and the brain \nactivity associated with the peg tasks were also examined.   \n \nResults: The oxy -Hb signal in the contralateral sensori motor cortex increased during  the peg tasks that requir ed hand \ndexterity  compared with the control task , whereas  we found  no significant difference between tasks in the prefrontal \nregion.  On the other hand, the correlation analysis showed s ignificant positive correlations in seven channels  around \nthe prefrontal cortex  during right -handed manipulation . In particular , a significant correlation was observed  in the \ncontralateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r=0.6, p<0.05). The result s indicate  that the higher the hand dexterity, the \ngreater the prefrontal cortex activity during  the peg tasks . \n \nConclusion:  In the present study, we confirmed that the contralateral motor cortex was more activated  during the peg \ntasks requiring hand dexterity. In addition, brain activity in the prefrontal cortex was more pronounced in those with \nhigher hand dexterity scores. The results suggest a strong  link between hand dexterity and the prefrontal cortex. More  \ndata needs  to be collected in the future to draw  a more reliable conclusion.  \n \nReferences: [1] Ehrsson, H. H.  et al.

    "Resting state functional connectivity at birth in very preterm \nneonates: Preliminary results on its relation with glucose \nvariability and neurodevelopmental outcome  \n \nDe Pietri1*, Bianco1*, Perkins1, Guiducci1, Lasagni1, Cusinato1, Avagliano1, Res1, Savio1, Di \nGiorgio1, Priante1, Galderisi2, Baraldi1, Brigadoi1  \n \n1University of Padova, via VIII Febbraio 2 , 35122 Padova, Italy; 2Yale School of Medicine, New H aven, Connecticut, United States   \nPresenting Author email address: sabrina.brigadoi@unipd.it  \n \nAbstract:  Neurodevelopmental outcome in very preterm neonates might be impaired and this \nimpairment might be moderated by glucose variability at birth . Here, we monitored very preterm \nbabies at birth with DOT and continuous glucose monitoring and  followed them up at 12 and 24 \nmonths of age.  Changes in r esting state functional connectivity (RSFC) matrices were correlated \nwith glucose variability metrics and neurodevelopmental outcome. We found a positive correlation \nbetween RSFC changes in fronto -parietal network and glucose variability and some preliminary \nother correlations between RSFC and behavioral metrics at follow -up, suggesting a possible \nbiomarker role for RSFC at birth.  \n \nIntroduction:  Very preterm newborns (<32 weeks gestational age) are m ore prone to exhibit high variability in \nglucose concentration during the first weeks post -partum. Glucose instability has been associated with increased \nmortality and morbidity rates and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome [1]. Previous studies demonstrat ed a relation \nbetween glucose concentration and brain hemodynamics [ 2]. Preterm birth is, by itself, a risk factor for impaired \nneurodevelopmental outcome [ 3]. The aim of the present work it to investigate whether glycemic variability  in very \npreterm neonates can modify and modulate the brain patterns of resting state functional connectivity  (RSFC) at birth  \nand whether the RSFC at birth could be a marker of neurodevelopmental impairments at 12 and 24 months of corrected \nage. Methods: 47 preterm neonates (<32 weeks gestation or <1500 gr weight) were enrolled  in the neonatal intensive \ncare unit of Padova University Hospital. Newborns were monitored continuously and simultaneously with diffuse \noptical tomography (NTS Gowerlabs, 8 sources a nd 8 detectors, 64 channels covering the parietal, motor, frontal and \nsuperior temporal areas) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM, Medtronic) for a n average of 3.6 days  [20 hours \n– 6 days] . Infants were followed -up at 12 and 24 months corrected age to evaluate their neurodevelopmental outcome: \ncognitive, language, motor and socio -emotional development were assessed with Bayley III scaled of Infant and \nToddler Development, whereas visual atte ntion and memory were assessed with computerized tasks (gap -overlap and \nchange detection task [ 4,5]). RSFC was computed during the first 5 -minute window during which the patient was in \neuglycemia (72 -144 mg/dL) and during the last 5 -minute window of euglyc emia. DOT data were pre -processed by \npruning bad channels, correcting for motion artifacts with wavelet approach and band -pass filtering (0.009 -0.8 Hz). \nDOT data were then reconstructed by solving the inverse problem with Tikhonov regularization in an age -matched \nhead model . Seed -based RSFC was computed among 9 regions of interest defined according to the 10-20 system. \nDifferences in RSFC between the first and the last 5 -min window were correlated with metrics computed on the \nglucose signal measured wit h CGM (e.g., glucose variability, time in range, etc.). Data of 9 preterm infants out of 47 \nare available for this assessment. RSFC matrices during the first 5 -min window were further correlated with \nneurodevelopmental outcome metrics at 12  (data of 18 pre term infants available for this assessment)  and 24 months \nof age  (data of 12 preterm infants available) . Results:  A positive correlation between changes in RSFC and glucose \nvariability  (r=.95, p<.05)  was found in the left fronto -parietal network after correction for multiple comparisons. \nSeveral preliminary (no correction for multiple comparisons) significant correlation s were found between RSFC and \nneurodevelopmental outcome, particularly with attention and language metrics.  Conclusion:  These preliminary \nresults suggest that RSF C at birth in preterm neonates might be impacted by glucose variability and that RSFC pattern \nat birth might be linked to neurodevelopmental outcome.

    "fNIRS Monitoring of Dynamic Stimulus in Immersive \nVirtual Reality Environment  \n \nZephaniah Phillips V1,*, Seung-Hyun Lee1, Beop-Min Kim2 \n \n1Global Health Technology Research Center, College of Health Science, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea ),  \n2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea  \n*Presenting Author email address: zphillips@korea.ac.kr  \n \nAbstract:  Continous fNIRS cerebral monitoring in immersive virtual reality environments gives an \ninnovative perspective of human cognition in realistic , multi -sensory, and quickly changing \nsituations. This study aims to explore the ability of fNIRS monitoring to cap ture cerebral responses  \nto spontaneous  moments in VR.  Simultaneous fNIRS -VR monitoring was performed as subjects \nfreely interacted with a VR environment. Cerebral activation was localized according to sudden \ntasks of free walking, gesturing, and cognition . These results demonstrate the potential for fNIRS -\nVR monitoring for innovative cognitive studies of dynamic stimulation.  \n \nIntroduction:  Typical cognitive studies are task -evoked , involving  a single stimulation to pinpoint  cerebral activation . \nHowever, re alistic human cognition  involves  varied visual -audio experiences  and occurs  at irregular time points . \nRecently, virtual reality (VR) technologies have  aided in recreating realistic cognitive situations to perform innovative \nstudies difficult to administer in real life . Due to functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) compactness, \nrobustness to motion artifacts, and real -time monitoring, fNIRS monitoring has the potential to reveal dynamic \ncognitive networks as subjects’  freely interact with VR.  \n \nMethods: Subjects  (n=5) were equipped with the NIRSport2 backpack system and had a 20-minute  continuous VR \nexperience in the Oculus headset  (Fig. 1 (A)).  A custom -developed VR maze environment with interactive components \nwas created in the VREX open -source  toolbox.  Accelerometer data was used to censor motion time points and assist \nin motion regression.  (Fig. 1 (B)) Data processing  and connectivity analysis  were  performed using  the Homer3 and \nBrain Connectivity Toolbox.  \n \nResults: Strongest cortical activation was observed when subjects engaged in motor activities related to hand \nmovements and free walking. Supplementary  motor area  activation was observed  related to movement coordination \nand grasping tasks.  (Fig. 1 (C))  In addition, simultaneous monitoring of the visual and motor cortex reveals connective \ncognitive networks related to the visual processing and sequential  motor execution of tasks in VR.  \n \nConclusion:  This work highlights the potential of accurate monitori ng of cognition during spontaneous VR moments \nusing fNIRS. By identifying cerebral activation during VR moments that the subject encounters at their own will, we \nhave better insight into how human cognition works in a more naturalistic setting. Advancement s in VR will help \ndevelop various sandbox scenarios, where experiment ers can mold scenario s and test complex human cognition.  \n \nAcknowledgement : This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National \nResearch Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (RS -2023 -00250634)  and t he Korea \nMedical Device Development Fund grant funded by the Korea government (the Ministry of Science and ICT, the \nMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy, the Ministry of Health & Wel fare, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety) \n(Project Number: KMDF -RS-2022 -00140478)  \n97 of 398",

However, how mental\nworkload (MWL) during work and gaming affect the users’ recovery experience is unknown.\nParticipants undertake high and low-demand work tasks followed by high and low-demand gaming\ntasks. FNIRS and subjective scales are used to measure participants’ brain activity, MWL, and\nrecovery experience. Results show that low MWL gaming enhances recovery after high MWL work,\nwhile high MWL gaming aids recovery following low MWL work. Furthermore, HbO\nconcentrations correlates with MWL and recovery experience. Our findings indicate that opposite\nMWL levels between work and gaming optimize recovery.\nIntroduction: Recovery from work-related strain is essential for maintaining job readiness and productivity1.V i d e o\ngaming has emerged as a beneficial activity for post-work recovery2.A l t h o u g hc e r t a i nt y p e so fv i d e og a m e sa r e\nknown to facilitate recovery, the underlying factors contributing to their effectiveness remain unclear. One notable\ngame feature, challenge, relates not only to the mental workload (MWL) but also to mastery experiences during\nrecovery. This study hypothesizes that MWL plays a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of games in aiding post-\nwork recovery. The primary objective is to elucidate how MWL, both during work and in gaming, influences post-\nwork recovery experiences and outcomes.\nMethods: Our pilot study involved four regular gamers, each playing over three hours per day. In Experiment 1, two\nparticipants engaged in a high-demand transcription task for 20 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of a low-demand\ngame (Bubble Shooter), another similar transcription task, and then a high-demand game (Pac-Man) for 10 minutes.\nDuring the experiment, the Artinis Brite fNIRS device was used to measure participants’ brain activity within the\nprefrontal cortex (PFC). Participants’ perceived workload (NASA-TLX), recovery experience (REQ) and recovery\noutcomes (ADACL) were also assessed. Experiment 2 mirrored Experiment 1, substituting the transcription task with\nlow-demand typing tasks for the other two participants.\nResults: The study found that MWL may correlate positively with task demand in both work and gaming contexts. It\nappears that high-demand gaming may enhance energetic arousal more significantly than low-demand gaming,\nirrespective of the prior work demand. Observations suggest that following high-demand work tasks, low-demand\ngames could potentially provide a better overall recovery experience. Conversely, after low-demand tasks, high-\ndemand games might improve recovery experiences. Additionally, regardless of the work type, high-demand games\npossibly offer a more substantial mastery experience. The data indicated that HbO concentrations in the prefrontal\ncortex tentatively correlate with both MWL and overall recovery experiences.\nConclusion: This pilot study tentatively explored the impact of MWL on post-work recovery using gaming. The\npreliminary findings suggest that selecting games with lower MWL after high-demand work tasks may lead to\nimproved recovery experiences; similarly, choosing games with higher MWL following low-demand tasks might also\nenhance recovery outcomes. Notably, regardless of the work's MWL, playing high-demand games consistently seemed\nto provide better Mastery and more energetic arousal. These initial results highlight the potential benefits of adjusting\ngaming strategies based on MWL for recovery purposes. However, due to the small sample size, these conclusions\nare provisional. Moving forward, expanding the participant pool will be crucial to confirm these findings and solidify\nour understanding of gaming as a recovery tool.\nReferences\n1. Collins, E. & Cox, A. L.

    "Building behavioral and neural foundations for infant \nfNIRS-neurofeedback  \n \nCachal Neubur ger1, Michal Ramot2, and Sagi Jaffe -Dax1,3 \n \n1Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University , 2Weizmann Institute of Science , 3School of Psychological Sciences, Tel Aviv University , \nPresenting Author email address: cachaln@mail.tau.ac.il  \n \nAbstract:  The aim of the current study was to ascertain the feasibility of developing an fNIRS -\nneurofeedback protocol for infants. The first part of the study was to ensure an effective training \nparadigm by assessing spontaneous  infant preferences of visual stimuli. B uilding on  these findings, \nwe designed a  training paradigm that will intrinsically motivate specific neural feature s. In the \nsecond part, we conducted preliminary tests of the task to determine offline the best online signal \nprocessing and neurofeedback algorithm. Combined, these findings will provide the foundation for \nfuture research to develop a protocol for infant f NIRS -neurofeedback.  \n \nIntroduction:  The infant brain undergoes rapid changes in anatomy and connectivity . Can this heightened plasticity \nbe directed non -invasively by neurofeedback?  Interest in neurofeedback has grown exponentially over the years, \nallowing for the development of a tool enabling both basic science research as well as clinical interventions . Research \nin neurofeedback utilizing fNIRS, a neuroimaging tool commonly used in infant populations has only recently gained \ninterest . However, to date, no one has attempted to develop a neurofeedback protocol for infants. Such an endeavor \ncould provide a novel look at causality between neural activation, connectivity, and infant behavior. Furthermore, \ngiven the heightened neural plasti city in infancy, neurofeedback could provide a non -invasive strategy for clinical \ninterventions at this critical age.  In thi s study, we hope to develop a protocol for infant  neurofeedback utilizing fNIRS \nto explore prediction , a fundamental ability in human  behavior . \nMethods: Study 1  focused on spontaneous infant preferences , \nthat do not require learning,  and included two  separate  \nexperiments ; speed preference s and color saturation \npreferences . In both experiments , 20 infants (age range:  5-13 \nmonths ) were shown  two audio -visual stimuli  on a split screen . \nThe two video stimuli differed in their speed (Experiment 1.1) \nor saturation (Experiment 1.2).  Preferences were \noperationalized by looking time to each stimulus  during \npresentation . Study 2 focused on reproducing findings on \ncortical  activation  and functional connectivity during a \nprediction paradigm . In this study, 20 infants (age range: 5 -9 \nmonths) are shown  stimuli presented in either predictable or \nunpredictable order.  This study ha s 3 aims : 1) to estimate \nwithin and between infant differences in cortical activation and \nfunctional connectivity associated with prediction; 2) to \nevaluate optimal parameters for real -time signal processing \nusing offline optimization  methods of real -time algorithms; 3)  \nto develo p an optimal neurofeedback algorithm  for prediction  \ndependent on the cortical activation in general and functional \nconnectivity  patterns in particular.  \nResults: In Study 1, preliminary results  suggest  that infants show  a clear preference for faster stimuli over slower \nstimuli  (Experiment 1.1;  OR: 1.45, CI 95%:  1.18-1.77). Similarly, we expect to find a preference for more saturated \ncolors over less saturated colors (Experiment 1.2).  In Study 2, we expect to find individual differences in cortical \nactivation and in functional connectivity, specifically with greater connectivity between the frontal and temporal \nregions  in predictable compared to unpredictable stimuli.   \nConclusion:  The two studies presented above lay the foundation for further development of  an fNIRS -neurofeedback \nprotocol with infants. The first study provides evidence for unlearned  (perhaps even innate ) preferences in infants. \nWe hope to utilize these preferences as motivation for neural activation in future neurofeedback research.  The second \nstudy provides the basis for the development of a neurofeedback algorithm , including the  target of the neurofeedback \nprotocol, and an  optimal online processing  pipeline .   \nFigure 1: Schematic illustration of the \nneurofeedback setup  to be developed based on \nresults of Study  1 (training paradigm) and \nStudy 2 (processing pipeline and \nneurofeedback algorithm) . \n99 of 398",

We measure brain \nactivations of 3 -to-5-year-olds while interacting with toddler -avatars in a virtual playground during \nemotional and neutral scenarios. Preliminary results showed greater activations of regions related to \nempathy for emotional relevant compared to neutral scenarios, and greater responses for emotional ly \nrelevant scenarios in the VR task compared those  in a standard  computerized  task. Advantages and \nchallenges of designing fNIRS/VR tasks with preschoolers will be discussed.  \n \nIntroduction:  A child’s social life is rich  and dynamic, and standard lab tasks  might  not be appropriate to capture it1. \nRecent advances in technology have made it possible to test children with fNIRS during more naturalistic conditions . \nWe recently validated a combined fNIRS/VR set -up to assess  preschoolers’ social development2. Here  we designed a \nVR task to measure preschoolers’  empathy , i.e. the \nability to understand and share others ’ emotions3. We \naim to explore preschoolers’ neural markers of \nempathy during naturalistic emotionally relevant \nscenarios  in a VR task . We will also compare \npreschoolers’ markers of empathy elicited by  the VR \ntask with those elicited by a standard lab task.   \nMethods: 3-to-5-year-olds are tested in the immersive \nvirtual reality (CAVE), whil e we measure  activations \nfrom the frontal and temporoparietal cortex  (known to \nbe engaged in empathy3) with wearable fNIRS.  In a \nvirtual playground, preschoolers are exposed to emotional  \nand neutral interactions with toddler -avatar s, and can  actively \ninteract with them  by touching some clouds. The same \nparticipants are tested with a computerized  block -design task with \nemotional and neutral scenarios  (presented in another abstract) . \nfNIRS channels without clear heart -rate signal are pruned using \nQT-NIRS4, motion artefacts are corrected with wavelet5. Data are \nband -pass filtered. Oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated blood \n(HHb) changes are  analysed with a GLM approach.   \nResults: Data collection is ongoing . 85% of the preschoolers \ntested preferred the task in the CAVE to the standard one.  \nPreliminary results (N=8) showed greater activations of the \nbilateral  medial prefrontal cortex , right superio r temporal gyrus  \nand left inferior parietal lobe  for emotional compared to neutral \nscenarios.  Most of the responses  showed a deep undershoot after \na first increase, which is not present in the standard task (Fig. 1). \nPreliminary comparison s between the two tasks in one  participant  \nshowed greater activation for the  emotional  scenarios in the CAVE compared to those  in the standard task (Fig. 2).  \nConclusion:  These results  will advance our understandings of the mechanisms behind empathy development, opening \nnew avenues of research on children’s social development. By comparing preschoolers’ responses  to a traditional lab \ntask with one in a naturalistic  setting, we will discuss advantages  and challenges  of ecologically -valid task designs \nwith fNIRS . \n1.Wass, Jones, JCPP (2023). 2.Bulgarelli, Pinti, Aburumman, Jones.

    "Assessing preschoolers’ structural action processing in a \nstacking game using fNIRS  \n \nLea Haerms1,2, Laura Maffongelli1,2, Charlotte Grosse Wiesmann3, Markus Paulus4, Angela Friederici3, \nNicole Altvater -Mackensen1,2 \n \n1Johannes -Gutenberg -University Mainz, German y; 2University of Mannheim, Germany ; 3Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and \nBrain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany ; 4Ludwig -Maximilians -University Munich, Munich, Germany ;  \nLea.haerms@uni -mannheim.de  \n \nAbstract:  The ability to plan and understand  complex action s considerably develops around the \npreschool years . Despite suggestions that structural processing of action and language relies on \nsimilar mechanisms recruiting subregions of the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) , the underlying \nneural mechanisms of children’s action processing are largely unknown.  To investigate \nstructural  action processing  and its neural correlates , the current study examined 3- to 6-year-\nolds in a stacking game using  fNIRS. Contrasting with previous findings on language  processing , \nour results  show right -lateralized modulations in IFC activation depending o n complexity of \naction structure  and children’s behavioral performance . \n \nIntroduction:  Along with language and Theory of Mind, complex action understanding critically develops within \nthe preschool years (Greenfield, 1991).  It has been suggested that structural action processing recruits the inferior \nfrontal cortex (IFC), which is critically involved in hierarchical processing in language (Fadiga, et al., 2009).  \nRecent meta -analyses on action and language processing in adults suggest that different subregions of the  left IFC \nunderlie structural processing of language and action  (Zaccarella, et al., 2021).  However, to this date, only few \nstudies investigated structural action processing in children. The current study therefore  assessed  preschoolers’ \naction planning and execution and its neural correlates . If structural action processing parallels findings in language \nprocessing, we hypothesize d that structural complexity of action sequences modulate s the activation of regions in \nIFC, with stronger activation for dependent than sequential sequences  (Friederici , et al., 2006) . If such activation \nindexes structural processing, we further expect ed correlations between task performance and neural response.  \nMethods: In total, 78 children aged 3 - to 6-years participated  in a stacking game , consisting of  six blocks  varying \nin size and shape. Two toy figures were  placed on opposite ends of a small  board. Children were instructed to \nplace the blocks on to the board , building a pathway that allows both figures to visit each other. Task levels \ninclude d two structures: Unconstrained, sequential  action sequences, in which placing order of the blocks was \nflexible (no stacking of blocks) , and constrained , dependent action  sequences , in which blocks needed to be placed \nin a specific  order  (stacking of blocks) . Children were presented  with twelve levels of increasing difficulty , six in \neach condition. We measure d children’s neural response using fNIRS in a 30 second planning phase, during which  \nthe child c ould see the level set up but not reach it , followed by a 60 second building phase, in which  the child \nsolved the level by placing the blocks.  Children’s behavioral performance was coded based on their success.   \nResults: Preliminary results of block -averaged data of the first 45 participants  show  increases in HbO  in two \nregions of interest in inferior (BA45) and posterior (BA44/ BA6) parts  of frontal cortex which are right -lateralized , \nF(1,42)=5.421, p=.025, with stronger  increases for sequential than dependent levels, F(1,42)=8.860, p=.005, \nparticularly in posterior regions, F(1,42)=9.324, p=.004. This was further modulated by behavioral performance. \nSplitting the data based on mean success rates into low performers , who tend to solve mainly sequential levels , \nand high performers, who also solved a substantial number of dependent levels , reveals stronger activation for \ndependent than sequential levels in high performers,  F(2,42)=7.20, p=.002 . While h igh performers mainly  \nrecruit ed posterior regions , low performers show stronger activation in  inferior regions,  F(2,42)=4.574, p=.016 . \nConclusion : Children seem to recruit different regions of frontal cortex in the right hemisphere for action sequence \nplanning depending on the action’s structural complexity  and children’s capacity to solve structurally complex \naction tasks.  Further analysis will include remaining participants  and more fine -grained analysis of correlations \nbetween behavioral performance and neural activation.  \n \nReferences  \nFadiga, L., Craighero, L., & D’Ausilio, A.

    "A broadband NIRS system for bi-hemispheric, multi -\ndistance brain oximetry  \n \nArchie Barraclougha, Frédéric Langea, Subhabrata Mitrab and Ilias Tachtsidisa \naDepartment  of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK,  \narchie.barraclough.23@ucl.ac.uk  bInstitute  for Women’s Health, University College London, London, UK  \nAbstract:  We present a  new broadband near -infrared spectroscopy  system  which  has four detectors , \nwith multiple  source -detector separations, allowing  for simultaneous measurement from both \ncerebral  hemispheres along with the use of multi -distance spectroscopy to obtain measurements of \nabsolute tissue oxygen saturation. The platform is optimised for assessment of neonatal hypoxic -\nischemic encephalopathy  in a clinical environment . Initial results will be presented  at the meeting , \ndemonstrating the use of the platform on optical  phantoms and adult volunteers.  \n \nIntroduction:  Hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy  (HIE) is a form of brain damage caused by lac k of sufficient oxygen \nsupply to the brain before, during or shortly after birth . It is a serious complication , leading to lifelong dis ability or \ndeath  by 2 years of age in 40 -60% of cases  [1]. Broadband n ear-infrared spectroscopy ( bNIRS) is a non-invasive \noptical imaging modality  which allow s for low-cost, real -time brain monitoring  at the bedside , show ing promise for  \nassessment and monitoring of  neonates with HIE  [2]. The aim of this research is to upgrade the bNIRS component of \nan existing in -house hybrid bNIRS and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) instrument. The upgraded bNIRS \nsystem should  measure absolute tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) as well as cellular metabolic activity through the  \noxidation state of the enzyme cytochrome -c-oxidase  (oxCCO) . These combined measurements will provide an \nopportunity for further investigation into the physiological mechanisms underlying HIE as well as the  potential to \ncontribut e towards a more  accurate assess ment of  HIE injury severity, prognosticat ion of  outcomes and monitor ing of  \ntreatment  approaches . \n \nMethods:  The bNIRS system in the device  consists of a broadband tungsten  halogen light source  (8.4mW output \npower, HL-2000 -HP-FHSA  Ocean  Optics , USA) and 4 detector  channels, each connected to a custom -made  \nspectrometer (667-924nm, 2048  pixels , Wasatch Photonics, USA).  The system uses two detectors  for each cerebral \nhemisphere, allowing multiple source -detector separations , which are use d for StO 2 estimation  from the raw spectra \nusing the  BRUNO algorithm  [3]. This algorithm combines and expands  the commonly used  spatially resolved \nspectroscopy and broadband fitting  (or second de rivative spectroscopy)  algorithms and  has been shown to recover \nStO 2 with higher accuracy than either alone. Optical fibers  (0.55 NA, Fiberoptic Systems, USA) were used to direct \nlight to and from the subject and a 3D printed bracket was designed to hold the fibers in position during acquisition.  \nTo control the instrument,  software was written in Python using the Qt framework to create a modern, user -friendly \ngraphical user interface.  \n \nResults: Figure 1 shows a screenshot from  the graphical user \ninterface of the instrument taken during a test of one of the four  \ndetectors , performed  on an adult arm , with the graph  showing the \nmeasured spectr um. We are collecting results to demonstrate the \naccuracy and reliability of the system on optical  phantoms  and \nhuman adult volunteers  which will be  presented  at the meeting . \n \nConclusion:  We have presented a technical overview of a bNIRS \nsystem designed  for monitoring of neonates with newborn brain \ninjury . Future work will be to combine the upgraded bNIRS system \nwith DCS and assess  the ability of this hybrid  platform to predict \nneurodevelopmental outcome s and inform therapeutic decisions in a \nclinical context.   \n \nReferences:  \n[1] Allen, Kimberly A., and Debra H.

This \nstudy simultaneously monitored peripheral and cerebral vasomotion using near -infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRS) paired with continuous wavelet transform (CWT)  analysis . The results reveal \nthat the peripheral microcirculation is a more consistent target for detecting early MVD during \nsepsis than the brain, likely due to partial early protection of vital organs.  \n \nIntroduction:  Sepsis is a life -threatening host response to infection , which particularly affects vulner able individuals \nwith reduced access to timely medical intervention1. Since early intervention is directly related to survival2, there is a \nneed for accessible technology to aid early sepsis identification and triaging. Peripheral microvascular dysfunction \n(MVD), detectable as impaired arteriolar vasomotion , is an early indicator of sepsis, preceding tissue injury and septic \nshock3. Furthermore, c ognitive dysfunction is a common burden  among septic patients4, but the role of cerebral MVD \nand its timing with respect to peripheral MVD is poorly understood.  Previous work has shown increased amplitude of \nlow-frequency  oscillations in skeletal muscle microvascular hemoglobin content (HbT) to be a sensitive marker for \nearly MVD  during sepsis3. This parameter can be quantified with near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) paired with \ncontinuous wavelet transform (CWT). The objective of this study was to continuously monitor low-frequency HbT \noscillations simultaneously in the brain and skeletal muscle to compare cerebral and peripheral microvascular function \nin vivo  in a rat model of early sepsis.  \n \nMethods: This study used 10 Sprague -Dawley rats , equally divided into male and female. Control animals (n=4) \nreceived an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of saline, while experimental  animals (n=6) received an IP injection of \nautologous fecal slurry  to induce sepsis . NIRS measurements  were taken from  the scalp and hind limb of the animals \nfor 6 hours post injection. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and blood lactate were measured throughout the experiment. \nHbT was quantified using a fitting algorithm  based on  the Modified Beer -Lambert law5. The power of low -frequency \nHbT oscillations were quantified using CWT  and compared for differences across condition ( control vs. septic), time, \nand t issue (skeletal muscle vs. brain) using multiple two -way ANOVAs.  \n \nResults: The experimental animals experienced irreversible hypotension by \n6 hours , and their blood lactate was elevated th roughout  the experiment. The \npower of l ow-frequency HbT oscillations were significantly higher in the \nbrain of septic animals 4 -6 hours post injection. In the septic  skeletal muscle , \nthe power of oscillations was greater  from 2 -4 hours post injection. Low-\nfrequency HbT oscillations had a greater power  in the skeletal muscle than \nthe brain of septic animals . \n \nConclusion:  NIRS is a promising , accessible tool for  early detection of  \nMVD in sepsis and suggests  that the brain is partly protected  in early sepsis . \nFuture work will increase sample size and validate findings in ICU patients.  \n \nReferences:  [1] Rudd, K.

Our findings reveal significant \nmodulation of IBS by environmental variables, including interpersonal distance, music, virtual \nreality, and background noise. Brain regions implicated encompass the frontal, parietal, occipital, \nand te mporal lobes, elucidating the complex neural networks underlying social cognition. Despite \nthe limited number of studies, our review  emphasizes the importance of considering environmental \ncontexts when studying social interactions. Furthermore, it highlights this is a novel, emerging area \nof research poised for further exploration and expansion across interdisciplinary domains.  \nIntroduction:  Social interactions are fundamental to human existence, shaping relationships, emotions, and overall \nwell-being. Hyperscanning methodologies have recently emerged, enabling the simultaneous measurement of brain \nactivity across multiple participants as they  interact.  This innovative approach has revealed the phenomenon of inter -\nbrain synchrony (IBS), where neural activities of interacting individuals synchronize and reciprocally influence each \nother in real -time. The environment, whether physic al or virtual, actively shapes social dynamics and communication \npatterns. Our research aims to explore  what is known about  the modulation of IBS between interacting individuals \nunder varying environmental conditions. Within  this context, environmental conditions refer to external factors \npresent within an experimental setting.  \nMethods:  \nResults: The studies focused on healthy young adults. \nExperimental protocols varied, ranging from finger \ntapping coordination tasks to storytelling interactions and \nsimulated concert scenarios. Imaging modalities such as \nfNIRS and EEG captured neural dynamics, with \nmultichannel config urations allowing assessment of brain \nactivity patterns across cortical areas  including the frontal, \nparietal, occipital, and temporal lobes . Preprocessing and \nanalysis methods varied, employing techniques like \nWavelet Transform Coherence (WTC) and Phase L ocking \nValue (PLV) analysis to measure IBS. Environmental \nfactors significantly influenced IBS patterns , behavioral  \ncoordination and speech comprehension . Conclusion:  \nThis review sheds light on the significant impact of \nenvironmental conditions on IBS, paving the way for a \nnew genre of possible experiments. This emerging field is \ncritical to explore, as understanding environmental \ninfluences is vital for developing inte rventions and \ndesigning social settings that promote social cohesion.  \nDeclaration of interest: This study was part funded by  \nGivaudan UK Ltd.

    "STEM training promotes inhibitory control of left -behind \npupils: an fNIRS study reveals ³compensatory mechanism´  \n \nKeya Ding1, Yining Shen1, TianHang Gao1, Hui Li2 \n \n1 Shanghai Institute of Early Childhood Education, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China  \n2Faculty of Education and Human Development, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China  \n \nAbstract:  The present study recruited the fNIRS technique to assess the effectiveness of improving \nleft-behind children’s inhibitory control. Sixty -one fourth -grade pupils were divided into \nexperimental and control groups to participate in the study with the experim ental received a two -\nweek designed -based STEM training. The Stroop task was conducted before and after the training \nto assess the effectiveness. Results found that there are significant differences between control and \nexperimental groups in pre -and post -test in MFG and SFG, suggesting that design -based STEM \ntraining could be an effective method in promoting children’s inhibitory control ability.  \n \nIntroduction:  Early adverse experiences such as left -behind status are closely related to the impairment of brain \nfunction and structure  (Zhao et al., 2021; Ding et al. 2023),  and executive function (EF) is crucial to early brain \ndevelopment.  Design -based Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has been used \nworldwide and has been proven to be effective on young children’s EF) such as planning and inh ibitory control. while \nearlier research has explored the effects of design -based  STEM learning on students' academic performance and \nabilities in behavioral data (e.g., Wan, So & Zhan, 2023; Leonard et al., 2016), few have focused on the effects of \ndesign -based STEM on left -behind children’s EF utilizing neuroimaging techniques. There fore, this present study \nfocused on left -behind children and evaluated the effectiveness of design -based STEM in improving their inhibitory \ncontrol ability by functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique.  \n \nMethods:  Dividing 61 children in rural China into an experimental group (aged 10.70 ± 0.47 years, n=30) and a \ncontrol group (aged 10.77 ± 0.43 years, n=31), the present study conducted a two -week design -based STEM training \nwas conducted for the experimental group and assessed the inhibitory control ability by a Stroop task before and after \nSTEM training. All ten activities followed the reverse en gineering STEM learning approach, including pre -screening, \ndissecting & analyzing, resembling & testing, and redesign & innovation (Ladachart et al., 2022; Younis & Tutunji, \n2012).  Four brain regions of interest (ROI: Region A, B, C, and D, located in the  Middle Frontal Gyrus  (MFG ) and \nSuperior Frontal Gyrus of the brain  (SFG) and accuracy and reaction time were collected during the task.  \n \nResults: The results revealed that (1) Pretest brain activation in the experimental group was significantly higher than \nposttest in brain regions A and B during neutral and word conditions; (2)  The experimental group revealed a lower \nbrain activation than the control group after design -based STEM training; and (3) there was significant brain activity \ndifference among the three conditions of the Stroop task.  \n \nFigure 1 fNIRS probe configuration and Heat map of differences between experimental and control groups  \n \nConclusion:  These results suggest that design -based STEM training was effective in promoting children ’s inhibitory \ncontrol ability and there might be a “compensatory mechanism” underneath the insignificant behavioral performance \nand brain activation.  This finding will deepen our understanding of STEM on the executive function development of \nchildren  with biological evidence, and provide a basis and insight for education curriculum and its assessment.  \n106 of 398",
    "The Impact of Cognitive Styles on Exploratory Search \nBehaviour and Mental Workload   \n \nHuimin Tanga, Boon-Giin Leea, Dave Toweya, Max L. Wilsonb, Matthew Pikea \n \na School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, China  \nb School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK  \nPresenting Author email address: Huimin. Tang @nottingham.edu.cn  \n \nAbstract:  Cognitive Style affects  how people process information and the effort involved . This \nstudy examine d the differences in users' exploratory search behaviours  and mental workload (MWL) \nacross different cognitive style groups. Search behaviour  was analyzed using query logs, think -\naloud, and functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). MWL  was assessed using a subjective \nrating  and fNIRS. The results found a significant difference in activation levels  in different brain \nareas among different cognitive style groups when conducting the search tasks  using the same search \nengine . Our study emphasizes the significance of considering cognitive styles in search engine \ndesig n and understanding  search behaviours  through brain data.  \n \nIntroduction: Processing information  and learning  are a core part of our everyday lives . Cognitive style is one of the \nmain factor s influencing  search behaviour and how easily  people  find it to process information1. While the  effect  of \nthe wholist -analytic (WA) cognitive style  dimension on search behaviour  has been well studied, the  verbal -imagery \n(VI) dimension  has not . We investigate d the impact of cognitive styles on exploratory search behaviours  using a \ncombination of  query logs, think -aloud protocol, subjective ratings, and fNIRS data.  \n \nMethods: The study used the  VICS test and the Extended -WA test for cognitive style measurement2. Participants \nperformed three exploratory search tasks using  Google ’s default search page . Before starting the search tasks, \nparticipants were asked to relax for 30 seconds to establish the baseline fNIRS data. They were then required to begin \nthe search tasks when they saw a cross prompt . To capture clear fNIRS data for each  stage  in the search process, each \nsearch task was divided into a six -step process to slow down the search process: repeat “form/improve a query then \nevaluate the results” three times . After each step, they were asked to rate their mental workload using the ISA scale \nand then relax for 10 to 15 seconds to reduce  the influence of ISA on the  fNIRS data . After each task, participants \nrelaxed for 30 seconds to re -establish the baseline before proceeding to the next search task . Participants were also \nasked to thi nk aloud during the search tasks3, which were  recorded and analysed qualitatively . \n  \nResults and Conclusion : We analysed the area under the curve over the whole epoch ( AUC), the slope of the linear \nregression on the 6 first seconds of each epoch, and the average signal on the peak time range from 5 to 7 seconds \nfrom the search trigger onset ( mean) of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR). Among 40 participants, there \nwere 20 subjects  in both wholists and analytic groups. On the VI dimension, there were 26 verbalizers and 14 imagers. \nIn the Query Formulation  stage, wholists were more activ ated in the right VLPFC (a significantly lower HbR AUC) \nwhile analytics had a more activated left DLPFC (a significantly higher HbO AUC and a significantly lower HbR \nAUC). On the VI dimension, imagers were more activated in the right DLPFC  (a significantly higher  HbO slope) than \nverbalizers. During the Result Evaluation ,  the wholist group recruited the right DLPFC more (a significantly higher \nHbO slope & HbO mean), whereas the analytic group used the left VLPFC more (a significantly higher HbO AUC). \nNo noticeable differences were observed on the VI dimension. This study revealed  that different cognitive style groups \nrecruited different brain areas for perceiv ing and process ing the exploratory search  in different ways .  These results  \nhighlight  the feasibility of using fNIRS data to understand the relationship between cognitive styles and search \nbehaviours and demonstrate  that search interfaces  can be adapted for different cognitive styles to improve usability.  \n \nReferences : \n1.

    "Simultaneous broadband NIRS and EEG to characterise \nsocial brain specialisation in infants \nM.F. Siddiquia, P. Pintia, S. Brigadoi, S. Lloyd -Foxb, C.E. Elwellc, M.H. Johnsonb, I. Tachtsidisc, E.J.H. Jonesa \na Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck College, London, UK  \nb Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, UK  \nc Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL, London, UK  \nd Department of Development and Social Psychology,  University of Padova, Padova, Italy  \nPresenting author email address: Dr. Maheen Siddiqui : m.siddiqui@bbk.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Our current comprehension of functional specialisation in infants is limited to  insights of \neither spatial or temporal neural activation. We propose that functional specialisation is underpinned \nby coordinated physiological responses as part of the neurova scular coupling  (NVC)  pathway . To \ninvestigate this, we used broadband NIRS  (bNIRS) simultaneously with EEG to measure neural \nactivity alongside haemodynamic and metabolic changes in 4 -to-7-month -old infants, in response \nto social  and non-social stimul i. We demonstrated task- and frequency -dependent coupling between \nneural oscillatory activity, haemodynamics and metabolism. Development of simultaneous multi -\nmodal neuroimaging methods opens new vistas in understanding brain functional specialisatio n.  \n \nIntroduction: Functional specialisation is typically indexed through unitary imaging modalities that focus on either \nspatial selectivity (e.g., measuring changes in oxygenated blood using fNIRS or fMRI) or temporal selectivity (e.g., \nmeasuring neural activity using EEG). Other components of the NVC  pathway, such  as oxidative  metabolism , may \nalso contribute to the emergence of brain specialisation. This requires investigation of the coupling between neuronal \ndemand and oxygen and energetic supply . bNIRS provides measures of the oxidation status of mitochondrial enzyme \ncytochrome -c-oxidase (oxCCO) alongside haemodynamic changes. Here, we used  simultaneous bNIRS with EEG to \ninvestigate NVC  (i.e., the coupling between neural oscillations and haemodynam ic activity) and neurometabolic \ncoupling (i.e., the coupling between neural oscillations and metabolic activity). We expected differential coupling \nbetween neural oscillatory activity  and haemodynamics /metabolism, modulated by naturalistic social content.  \nMethods: Social and non -social visual and auditory stimuli were used in 42 4 -to-7-month -old typically developing \ninfants. bNIRS measurements were made using an in -house system developed at UCL. Infants wore custom -built \nheadgear with 9 channels over the right hemisphere (source/detector separation was 2.5 cm). Δ[HbO 2], Δ[HHb] and \nΔ[oxCCO] were calculated using changes in attenuation of light at \n120 wavelengths between 780 -900nm using the UCLn algorithm. \nEEG data was collected using the wireless Enobio system \n(Neuroelectrics, Spain) and 32 electrodes were positioned ac cording \nto the international 10/20 system (see Figure 1). The root mean \nsquare (RMS) power was calculated for each experimental trial and \naveraged across trials. A GLM model was used to understand how \nthe task -evoked neuronal activity predicts the hemodyna mic \nactivity. The resulting beta values were entered into one sample t -\ntests vs 0 to localize the brain regions with significant correlations \nbetween HbO 2, HHb and oxCCO and EEG in response to the task.   \nResults: Data from 14 infants were included. Figure 1 shows the \ngroup level activation maps , showing the channels where a \nstatistically significant relation was observed for different frequency \nbands . For the social condition, a high level of coupling was \nobserved b etween high -frequency beta/gamma oscillatory activity \nand haemodynamics/metabolism over the temporo -parietal region (a \ncore hub region of the adult social brain). Meanwhile, for the non -\nsocial condition, coupling was observed over the parieto -occipital \nregion in the beta band.  \nConclusion:  This study provides first measures exploring the \nrelationship between NVC mechanisms  in the developing human \nbrain. We developed novel methodology for multi -modal data integration which can be highly valuable in \ninvestigating early brain development , particularly in clinical populations and neurodevelopmental disorders.

    "Effects of Maternal Anxiety on Infant Learning  Under Uncertainty  \nAddison Billing*1,2, M. Berk Mirza1, Eleanor Smith1, Robert J. Cooper2, Rebecca P. \nLawson1 \n \n1Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge 2DOT -HUB, Medical Physics and Engineering, UCL  \nab2712@cam.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  The cognitive development of a child can be drastically influenced by a mother's post -\nnatal anxiety levels, particularly affecting their ability to adapt to a changing environment. In this \nstudy, we investigated the responses of infants in probabilistic associative learning (PLA) using \nhigh-density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT). Through the integration of gaze -tracking  and \nHD-DOT at the trial level, we were able to identify adult -like responses  to surprises, or prediction \nerrors,  in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Additionally, we found that differences in infants' \ncortical responses were correlated with post -natal maternal anxiety levels.  \nIntroduction:  Altered processing of uncertaint y is a hallmark feature of anxiety disorders.  Post-natal \nmaternal anxiety (PMA) affects a substantial proportion of new mothers, up to 43%, and can have a \ndetrimental impact on both somatic and psychological outcomes (Kuo et al., 2004). Given that PMA is know n \nto affect  the development of anxiety in offspring , we hypothesized that variations in PMA would correspond \nto differences in infant mPFC responses  associated with learning under uncertainty  (Alexander Brown, \n2011).  \nMethods: To investigate PLA, we employed a modified 80:20 ERP -style oddball paradigm (Emberson et al., 2015), \noptimized for both gaze -tracking (Tobii Ltd.) and HD -DOT (LUMO, Gowerlabs Ltd.). Maternal anxiety scores were \ndetermined using the STAI questionnaire. A final sample of 32 infants met criteria for sufficient data quality and trial \nnumbers for both types of data.  \nResults: As a preliminary analysis, we reconstructed Hb images; however, due to the brief event durations (2 seconds) \nand inherent noise in infant NIRS, group -level images were noisy (Fig. 1a). Gaze -tracking data revealed that a \nsignificant source of variation, bot h at the group and individual levels, was attributable to differences in task \nengagement. When accounting for engagement, we observed localized bilateral activation in the mPFC for the contrast \nbetween unexpected and expected events (right mPFC shown in Fig. 1b). In a secondary analysis, we investigated \nwhether variation in infant cortical responses for the unexpected - expected contrast related to PMA levels in the right \n(p_cor = 0.019) and left (p_cor = 0.29) mPFC (Fig.1 c). This association in t he right mPFC was driven by heightened \nresponses to unexpected events (p = 0.03) but not expected events (p = 0.88). Furthermore, an infant's response to \nunexpected stimuli in the right mPFC could predict the likelihood of their mothers having clinically d iagnosable \nanxiety levels (p = 0.02) (Grant et al., 2008).  \nConclusion:  This work shows adult -like medial prefrontal  responses associated with PLA in the infant population. \nFurthermore, infants whose mothers had higher trait anxiety  showed greater surprise, or ‘prediction error’ responses \nin this region . The simultaneous use of HD-DOT  and gaze -tracking allowed us to account for individual differences \nin the infant population  within an ERP -style paradigm . Future research will utilize gaze -tracking to enhance infant \nengagement in the paradigm.  \nFigure 1.

Univariate \nfrequency features and bivariate Functional Brain Connectivity  features are extracted from EEG \nacross Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands , and biomarkers of HbO and HbR are estimated from fNIRS.  \nLeveraging machine learning classifiers, our novel fused features  achieves 77% and 83% accuracy \nfor 0 -back vs. 2 -back and 0 -back vs. 3 -back, respectively, on a public dataset. Topographic \nvisualization highlights distinct EEG (POz) and fNIRS (AF8) regions for workload discrimination, \nunderscoring the method's efficacy.   \nIntroduction:  Addressing the imperative for accurate mental workload estimation, we propose a hybrid EEG -fNIRS \nframework for discriminating multi -level workload. Unlike prior studies focusing on single sensing modalities12, our \napproach integrates EEG and fNIRS, offering non -invasiveness, robustness, and cost -effectiveness. Integrating EEG \nand fNIRS modalities, we explore univariate EEG frequency features and bivariate functional connectivity  features. \nInvestigating linear and nonlinear FBC representations, we discern regional contributions to workload discrimination \nthrough topographic and heat maps. Our research advances methodological innovation and underscores multi -modal \napproaches' impor tance in workload assessment.  \n \nMethods: Dataset:  Dataset: Utilised dataset from Technische  Universität Berlin comprising EEG (30 channels) and \nfNIRS (36 channels) recordings during n -back tasks. Participants completed nine task sets across three sessions, each \ninvolving instruction, task, stop, and rest periods. Signal Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:  fNIRS data processed \nvia BBCI toolbox, sampling rate 10Hz. HbR and HbO values calculated via modified Beer -Lambert equation. EEG \ndata processed similarly, with sensitivity analysis determining 5s time window. Feature Selection and Fusion: \nANOV A employed for feature selection, with top 10 features from each modality combined to create 10 hybrid \nfeatures. Machine Learning Classification: SVM with RBF kernel utilized for classification, employing five -fold \ncross -validation . \n \nResults: Machine Learning Classification Performance:  Mutual Information  proved the most effective FBC method \nfor EEG -based classification. Across workload comparisons, EEG -based functional connectivity  features consistently \noutperformed PSD features. Hybrid EEG -fNIRS features yielded the highest accuracies for 0 -back vs. 2 -back and 0 -\nback vs. 3 -back tasks.  Visualization:  Topographic maps and heat maps depicted distinct brain activity patterns. EEG \nshowed prominent differences in Alpha -band activity, particularly in posterior areas. fNIRS highlighted differences \nin HbR concentrations, especially in right frontal areas. Heat  maps revealed significant functional brain connectivity \nchanges, emphasizing regio n-specific contributions to workload discrimination.  \n \nConclusion:  In this study , a novel solution relying on hybrid EEG -fNIRS features is proposed to deal with multi -level \nmental workload classification, supported by machine learning classifiers. To be more specific, the univariate PSD \nand four bivariate FBC features are extracted fr om EEG in three frequency bands. With the assistance of HbO and \nHbR indicators from fNIRS, the fused features improve the classification performance. Besides, the topographic and \nheat-map visualisation indicate the distinct regions  for EEG and fNIRS to represent the difference among 0 -back, 2 -\nback and 3 -back. Overall, the functional connectivity  technique based on EEG recording proved its capability in \nmental workload classification and the accuracy improvement emphasises the effectiveness of the hybrid EEG -fNIRS \napproach.  \n \n1.

For this purpose, we manipulate laughing \nin pairs of participants and subsequently measure interbrain synchrony with fNIRS  hyperscanning , \nbonding and joint action . We use a sequential Bayesian approach to achieve the sample size with a \nBayes factor of 5  or 1/5. A preliminary Bayes ANOVA  (N=84)  revealed  that the data for the \ninterbrain synchrony are in favor of the null hypotheses . Further variables (laughter, bonding) are \ncurrently  being  analyzed. Data collection is  ongoing.  \n \nIntroduction:  Laughter is a positive emotional vocalization  (Dunbar, 202 2). Interpersonal  synchrony  is proposed as \nan underlying mechanism of how  laughter could increase the feeling of bonding  between people  (Dunbar, 20 22). \nSynchrony  can be investigated at the neural leve l; it is a mechanism where brain activity  of one person aligns  with the \nbrain activity of another person. Brain areas activated during interbrain synchrony (IBS) are in frontal and temporal \nregions  (Gordon et al., 2023 ). IBS is a mechanism that promotes positive interaction  and because of its positive \ninfluence on people, research should be conducted into how synchrony works and how it can be promoted  (Gervais \n& Wilson, 2005) . There is evidence  that m ultimodal, rhythmical  and social stimuli support synchrony  (Markova et \nal., 2019) . Yet, laughter , which matches all these  characteristics , has not been studied yet in the context  of IBS.  \n \nMethods: We assess  pairs of same -gendered strangers. We already collected data from  84 participants ; 22 laughter \ndyads ( mean age 20.81 , female: 1 3, male: 9 ) and 20 control dyads with no induced laughter (mean age 22,075 , female: \n11, male: 9 ). Participants play a funny (or neutral) game and watch funny (or neutral) videos together . After the \nlaughter manipulation there are ten minutes of free interaction . During the free interaction , we measure  IBS of activity \nof the frontal (IFG) and temporal (TPJ) lobe with fNIRS hyperscanning . For measuring positive social outcome s \nbetween the participants,  they fill in questionnaires and play a joint action game . IBS is analysed with  the wavelet -\ntransform -coherence techniqu e.  \n \nResults: We performed  a 2x2 Bayes ANOVA  with the factor group and \ninteraction interval  (first and last five minutes  of the  ten minutes  of free \ninteraction ) for each brain area (right and left IFG and TPJ). The results \nsuggest that there is anecdotal and moderate evidence in favor of the null \nhypothesis  as indicated by the lower posteriors for the group models \ncompared to the null model and the Bayes factors closer to zero.  \n \nConclusion:  The first results of our analyses show that j ust having watched funny videos and play ed a funny game \ndo not lead to subsequently increased IBS compared to watch ing neutral videos and play ing a neutral game. \nHowever, we cannot conclude  if laughter has an effect  or not because  how much the participants  actually  laughed is \nnot necessarily reflected in the conditions. Therefore, we are going to investigate more in detail the individual \namount of laughter. Additionally, laughter might have a short -term effect , not carrying over to the free interaction \nphase . Therefore , we will also analyse IBS during  the laughter  manipulation.   \n \nReferences : 1. Dunbar R. I. M.  Laughter and its role in the evolution of human social bonding . Phil. Trans. R.

    "Hyperspectral time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy \ntechnique for adult neuromonitoring \n \nNatalie C. Li1*, Seva Ioussoufovitch1, and Mamadou Diop1,2,3  \n1Western University, Faculty of Engineering, School of Biomedical Engineering, 1151 Richmond St., London, N6A 5C1, Canada; 2Western \nUniversity, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Department of Medical Biophysics, 1151 Richmond St., London, N6A 5C1, Canada; \n3Lawson Health Research Institute, Imaging Program, 268 Grosvenor St., London, N6A 4V2, Canada \n*nli253@uwo.ca \n \nAbstract:  Hyperspectral time-resolved near-infrared spectrometers have the potential to monitor \nadult cerebral blood oxygenation and metabolism with minimal extracerebral contamination; \nhowever, they are typically limited by trade-offs between spectral range, spectral resolution, and \nsampling rate. This work presents a hyperspectral time-resolved near-infrared spectrometer that uses \ncompressive sensing to enable fast data acquisition while maintaining spectral range and resolution. \nThe sensitivity of the device to changes in blood oxygenation and metabolism in deep tissue was \nconfirmed in phantom experiments with comparison to gold standard measures. Future work will \nvalidate the sensitivity of the device to adult cerebral blood oxygenation and metabolism . \n \nIntroduction:  Cerebral blood oxygenation (oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, HbO and Hb) and metabolism (cytochrome-\nc-oxidase, oxCCO) can be continuously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The current gold \nstandard for monitoring oxCCO is based on hyperspectral continuous-wave (CW) NIRS and works very well in \nneonates; however, extending the technique to adults has been challenging because their thick extracerebral layers \n(scalp and skull) reduce sensitivity to the brain. Time-resolved (TR) techniques can improve sensitivity to the brain \nby recording the times-of-flight of the detected photons to separate the extracerebral and brain signals. Therefore, \nhyperspectral TR NIRS is a promising approach for monitoring oxCCO and blood oxygenation in the adult brain. \nUnfortunately, current systems that achieve the necessary spectral range and resolution typically suffer from long \nacquisition times, which are not adequate for dynamic physiological monitoring (>2 min). We have demonstrated in \npreliminary work that compressive sensing (CS) can be used to reduce acquisition time without sacrificing spectral \nrange and resolution [1]. Here we present a more advanced prototype of the compressive-sensing hyperspectral TR \nspectrometer and assess its sensitivity to changes in blood oxygenation and metabolism in deep tissue. \nMethods: The spectrometer reported in [1] was rebuilt to address the major limitations of the preliminary system. \nBased on a CS architecture, the modified spectrometer, named HyperTRCSS (Hyperspectral Time-Resolved \nCompressive Sensing Spectrometer; “hyper-tricks”), can acquire a 170-point TR spectrum spanning 675–875 nm \nevery 20 seconds. To demonstrate the sensitivity of HyperTRCSS to oxCCO and blood oxygenation changes in deep \ntissue, 2-layer tissue-mimicking liquid phantom experiments were performed (n=2). Each phantom was constructed \nin a container with a 10 mm thick top layer (i.e., scalp & skull) separated from the bottom layer (i.e., brain) by a thin \ntransparent membrane. Both layers contained phosphate-buffered saline, Intralipid, and whole animal blood. The top \nlayer remained static while the blood in the bottom layer was deoxygenated by yeast through oxidative metabolism \nand reoxygenated by bubbling oxygen gas. TR measurements were acquired from the surface of the top layer while \nCW measurements were acquired directly from the bottom layer for comparison. The TR data was analyzed using a \nlate-photon fitting approach, while the CW data was analyzed using a multi-step spectral derivative analysis using the \ndifferential form of the modified Beer-Lambert law. Spearman correlations between the TR and CW results were \ncalculated for each experiment (α = 0.05). In addition, Monte-Carlo simulations of the 2-layer phantom experiments \nwere conducted to provide a reference point for the experimental results. \nResults: The TR spectrometer was sensitive to changes in oxCCO and blood oxygenation beneath the 10 mm thick \nstatic top layer of the phantoms, confirmed by comparison to concomitant CW measures acquired directly on the \nbottom layer. The TR and CW measures of blood oxygenation were strongly correlated, and the noisier oxCCO traces \nwere moderately correlated, suggesting sensitivity to the same trends. The Monte-Carlo simulations support the \nfindings and clearly indicate that TR methods greatly minimize superficial layer contamination of brain signals. \nConclusion:  HyperTRCSS shows promise as a depth-sensitive alternative to traditional CW devices for monitoring \nblood oxygenation and oxCCO. While this work demonstrates the sensitivity of the novel device to oxCCO and blood \noxygenation changes in deep tissue, further work is necessary to experimentally demonstrate the relative reduction in \ntop layer contamination of TR versus CW. Future work will also investigate the sensitivity of the device to adult \ncerebral blood oxygenation and metabolism. \nReferences: [1] S.

    "Sex Matters: Identifying Neural Profiles as Predictors of Sex \nSpecific ADHD Subtypes \n \nLundstrum, E. 1, Patel, P.  1, Hudson, H.  2, & Kerr-German, A.N., PhD 1 \n \n1Department of Psychology, Mercer University, Macon, Ga, 31200   \n2Department of Psychology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville , TN 37901  \nPresenting Author email address: kerr-german_an@mercer.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Neurodevelopmental research on ADHD often fail to include females and all presenting subtypes within \nsample populations. Historical subtype diagnoses of ADHD have been specific to observed behavior primarily in one \nsex or the other. Sixty -four children ( female =34) were screened, categorized, and diagnosed and then administered a \npassive viewing resting paradigm  with a nearly full coverage, bilateral probe . Our results suggest that previous work \nmay be biased in conflating sex with subtype in neural profiles of ADHD. Phenotypical presentation of ADHD may \nbe dependent on sex specific neural circuitry above and beyond subtype presentations within this disorder.  \n \nIntroduction:  The aim of this study is to identify neural profiles of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  \nconsidering the intersection of sex. Behavioral profiles differ across sex, with males presenting on average e arlier in \nlife with a hyperactive subtype , while females present later in development with a more inattentive subtype . As a \nresult, females have been historically overlooked in terms of diagnoses before adulthood . Little research  has been \ndone on the neural underpinnings of this sexual dimorphism.  This study aims to examine the subtype difference, \nproposing differing neural profiles  based on the interaction between sex and subtype . \nMethods: Functional connectivity data was collected via near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in bilateral frontal -\ntemporal -parietal cortex via a 38 -channel probe design  in \nchildren aged 6-8 (N=62 ) with and without ADHD . Detailed \nKSAD interv iews were administered  to all children by a \nlicensed clinical psychologist in addition to medical record \nassessments for  familial history of ADHD  in order to  exclude  \nindividuals with any profound  additional developmental \ndisabilities  as well as  give insight into ADHD subtypes  and \npresentation  severity . Other factors , including parental stress, \nirritability, and aggression were scored for the participants \nusing the ARI -P and MAP -DB assessments . Children then sat for 10 minutes in a  classic viewing paradigm to assess \ncortical connectivity at rest in primary executive functioning and attention networks (i.e., dorsal,  and ventral \nprojections)  in participants.  \nResults: Typically developing (TD) males showed increased frontal crosstalk  when presented with a passive viewing \nparadigm. This overactivity in the frontal lobe is consistent with previous literature demonstrating  greater self -\nregulation is needed to sustain attention  during passive viewing in younger children . TD Females showed greater  \nconnectivity between frontal, midfrontal, and parietal regions  in left hemisphere  compared to TD males as well . Sex \ndifferences in how children execute passive viewing (i.e., semi -rest conditions)  may indicate that TD female sustained \nattention regulation may lie  in selectivity, as opposed to self-regulation based on these profiles . Females with ADHD \nin contrast  showed weaker connectivity in the same frontal/parietal networks  as TD females as well as greater \nconnectivity in frontal -parietal regions in right hemisphere . In contrast , males with ADHD  showed  stronger more \nwidespread  connectivity in the mid frontal areas associated in comparison to TD males . In addition, m ales with ADHD  \nshow hypoactivity in the left lateralized frontal/parietal network.  Additional analyses demonstrated a potential \nconflation between sex specific  and subtype specific connectivity profiles in the literature as our results s uggest that \nmales with ADH D demonstrate hypoactivity compared to TD males regardless of subtype (i.e., inattentive, combined, \nhyperactive) in left hemisphere while females with ADHD de monstrate hyperconnectivity regardless of subtype (i.e., \ninattentive, combined, hyperactive) in right hemisphere (see Figure 1).  \nConclusion:  Our work is the first to suggest that sex discrepancies in diagnosing as well as disproportional \nrepresentations of females in all three subtypes of ADHD may have sex specific neurological indicators.  \n \n \n114 of 398",
    "The Acting Self: using LIGHTNIRS to measure self -other \nactivations  in professional actors  \n \nD.A. Greaves1, A. Kokkinou1, J. Nicolodi1,2 and A.F.de.C.  Hamilton1 \n \n1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Social Neuroscience Lab, University College London, United Kingdom  \n2Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom  \n \nPresenting Author email address: dwaynica.greaves.20@ucl.ac.uk  \n \n \nAbstract:  An actor’s characterisation approach affects their intended character embodiment, hence \nsense of self. One way to measure the sense of self is by measuring  mPFC activation whilst hearing \nyour own name (Greaves & Pinti et al., 2022; Imafuku et al., 2014). Participants were 38 UK -based \nprofessional actors with 2+ years of industry experience. Name call events (own name, character \nname  & stranger name) occurred whilst actors performed a monologue and two control tasks. PFC \nactivity  was recorded with a 22 channel Shimadzu LIGHT NIRS system.  Findings revealed higher \nmPFC activity hearing ‘own name’ vs ‘stranger name’ in the monologue condition.  \n \nIntroduction:  Following on from our previous work  where we used fNIRS to hyperscan  the PFC of actors whilst they \nrehearse d in pairs for a live performance (Greaves & Pinti et al., 2022)  , we take a step back from hyperscanning to \nmeasure the PFC of solo actors performing a seated monologue towards a camera. One way to measure the sense of \nself is by measuring the mPFC’s activation when hearing your own name compared to other names (Greaves  & Pinti \net al., 2022; Imafuku et al., 2014). Therefore, we measured actors' PFC responses (with a specific focus on the mPFC) \nto hearing their own, character and stranger names during acting and non -acting conditions.  \n \nMethods: Participants were  38 UK -based professional actors with 2+ years of industry experience  including stage, \nfilm and commercial projects.  To measure brain activity  we administered a  Shimadzu LIGHTNIRS functional near -\ninfrared system with 22 channels across the PFC. We also used a Biosignalsplux breath belt to measure breathing rate. \nActors performed a monologue, coloured in a mandala colouring book, and read aloud from a telephone book. Each \ntask was  conducted whilst seated, lasted 2 minutes  and repeated 4 times in the same listed order. During each task, the \nactor's first name (own name)  , character name and a stranger's name  were  each played  twice  from a speaker at \npseudorandom  time intervals .   \n \nResults: Channel 4 (within the mPFC region) had higher brain activ ation  during the monologue condition compared \nto control conditions, as well as, higher activation when actors heard their own name compared to the stranger name \nduring the monologue condition. Channel 4 also had higher activation when actors heard their own na me in the \nmonologue condition compared to the telephone book (control) condition.  \n \nConclusion:  Stronger ‘mPFC ’ activ ity when  actors  hear their own name  compared to a stranger name  in the \nmonologue condition may indicate a stronger sense of self whilst in character, compared to the control conditions  \nwhere actors were  not required to be in character.  Interview responses from our actors (additional qualitative data \nfrom our study) revealed  that actors can intentionally create distance between themselves and their character  which \nenables them to  let go of the ir character  after the perform ance.   \n \nReferences  \n \nGreaves, D.

    "Brain Predictive Text Decoding using fNIRS \n \nTheodore Huppert1, Xuetong Zhai1, Hendrick Santosa2 \n \n1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \n2Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \nhuppert1@pitt.edu  \n \nAbstract:  In this work, we introduce a novel brain decoding scheme utilizing a brain -to-text model \ndeveloped by coordinate -based meta -analysis ( CBMA) of existing  functional MRI literature .   In this \napproach, which has been previously demonstrated for the interpretation of fMRI results, a \nmultivariate model linking reported brain activity coordinates converted to international 10 -20 space \nis statistically linked to words used in the publications associated with those coordinates.   The \nresulting model allows us to generate statistical word associations (word -clouds) from a n image of \nfNIRS brain activity projected to 10 -20 space.   \n \nIntroduction:  The data analysis package NeuroQuery [1] was developed by Dockés  et al based on meta -analysis of \nfMRI literature off PubMed.  In this model, the reported coordinates of brain activity from thousands of publications  \nare combined into a multi -variate statistical word association map, which links the activation pattern with key words \nfrom the abstract of the publications.  In the forward direction, the user input of words or phrases can be used to \ngenerate predictive patterns of brain activity.  For example, \nin Fig 1, the phase “ working memory ” generates activation \nfrom ap proximately of these 4,400 papers matching this \nkeyword . The original model developed by Dockés et al \nwas based on coordinates defined in three -dimensional \nTalairach  space  (Fig 1a) .  In this work, we modified and \nre-estimated the model as a depth -weighted two-\ndimensional model defined in international 10 -20 space.   \n \nMethods. NiMARE  [2] was first used to download and \nextract the 3D coordinates of brain activity reported in \naround 14,000  publications from PubMed.  The extracted 3D coordinates were then converted to 10 -20 space using a \nClarke’s azimuthal mapping projection  and an exponential depth weighting.  This depth weighting approximates the \nfNIRS “forward model”.  Next, using the term -frequency/inverse document frequency (TF -IDF) of words from the \nabstract of each publication is computed.  The T F-IDF is a measure of the relevance of a word discounting overly -\nfrequently used words across all documents.  An iterative, non -negative, sparse estimation approach is then used to \nfind the mapping between the T F-IDF vector for each publication and the 10 -20 brain coordinates reported.  We did \nthis by modifying code within the open -source Python package NIMARE (Neuroimaging meta -analysis research \nenvironment) [ 2].   Based on the 10 -20 space trained word -to-brain model, a GC-LDA  decoder can be used to predict \nthe top associated words from a given activation map  [3].   \nResults. Figure 2 shows word cloud associations from \nsynthetic fNIRS  data in right BA -46 projected to 10 -20 \nspace. We are currently working on means to test and \nvalidate this model using experimental data.  \n \nConclusion . The long -term prospective of this work is to \nexplore the paradigm shifting idea that rather than trying to \nclassify and predict a specific task (e.g. the subject is \nspecifically doing a 2 -back task) using real -time brain -\ncomputer interface classifiers, we would like to use this model to estimate the more general “category” of \ntask/cognition being used.  Although we are still working to validate and understand how to use these models, we \nhave developed a real -time pipeline (as part of the Brain AnalyzIR toolbox) to convert fNIRS data to 10 -20 maps and \ngenerate word clouds in real -time, which we hope to explore in the context of “real -world” and task -free studies.  \n \nReferences .

    "Multivariate Hierarchical Noise Models of fNIRS Data \n \nTheodore Huppert1, Xuetong Zhai1 \n \n1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \nhuppert1@pitt.edu  \n \nAbstract:  In this work, we present justification for why multi -level noise modeling is needed in \nfNIRS analysis and how miss -matched task -dependent noise (single -trial variability, measurement \nerrors, motion -artifacts, etc.) can result in crosstalk and under/over -estimation of statistical e ffects \nsizes between estimates of task results.  We propose a new multivariate, hierarchical GLM analysis.    \n \nIntroduction:  In the standard linear regression model, the confidence bounds on parameter estimates are defined \nbased on the regression design matrix and the mean squared error of the measurement residual.  For example, given \nthe standard linear model denoted:    !=#∙%+' \nthen the least -squares estimate of the uncertainty in the parameters ( %)\tis given by the equation  \n*+,!=(#\"∙#)#$∙.% \nwhere .% is the mean squared error of the residual ( '∈0(0,.%).  A consequence of this single level of noise is that \nthe relative uncertainty  in % between any two components does not depend on the data itself and instead only on the \nterm (#\"∙#)#$ defined entirely from the design of the study.  In other words, when there are two or more conditions \n(tasks) within a scan, the uncertainty in them is artificially coupled by this model.  This leads to the following \nundesirable consequences  of the traditional model : \n• If task -A is less reproducible than task -B, then the error in the estimate of B will be artificially inflated while \nthe error in A will be under -estimated.  \n•  If the noise is higher during the performance of the task compared to the noise in the baseline period (e.g. \ndue to motion or systemic noise specifically associated with the task), then the error bars in the task estimate \nwill be under -estimated and false positives may be present.  \n• All inter -trial variability is assumed to be due to measurement noise and any intrinsic interclass errors in \nrepeated tasks is neglected.   \n \nMethods: We have developed a new hierarchical, multivariate \nimplementation of the general linear model to overcome the limitation of \nthe single level (measurement noise only) conventional regression \napproach.  This approach adds multilevel modeling and estimation via a \nmaximum likelihood solver into our previously described auto -\nregressively pre -whitened, weighted least -squares regression model for \nfirst level fNIRS analysis.  In addition to modeling noise structures, we \nadditionally extend the model to simultaneous ly process all channels of \ndata at the same time using a multivariate autoregressive whitening \nstructure.  To test the p erformance of the model, we generated a set of \nnumeric simulation problems to highlight features of the model and used \nreceiver -operator characteristics (ROC) analysis to quantify the tradeoffs \nof sensitivity and specificity of the models.  Simulations were done with \nnoise representing:  \n• Single -trial variability in the evoked hemodynamic response with \nvaried levels of measurement and trial -level variance and evoked \neffect sizes.  \n• Additional task -dependent measurement errors  \n• Miss -matched task -dependent variance between two task conditions.  \n \nResults: The results of our ROC analysis simulations are presented in \nfigure 1.   All analysis and code were  implemented in the Brain AnalyzIR toolbox.   The new model showed \nimprovements of 143%, 121%, 60%, and 24% increases in sensitivity for SNR levels of 1, 2, 5, and 10 respectively \ncompared to the original AR -IRLS model.   \n \nAcknowledgments.

    "The role of the DLPFC in conflict adaptation –  \nA simultaneous fNIRS-EEG study \n \nAnn-Christine Ehlis, Lisa Zarantonello, Florian B. Haeussinger, Tim Rohe,  \nAndreas J. Fallgatter & Moritz J. Maier \n \nUniversity Hospital Tuebingen, Dpt. of Psychiatry & Psychotherapy, Calwerstr. 14, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany,  \nAnn-Christine.Ehlis@med.uni-tuebingen.de \n \nAbstract:  The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a key player in cognitive control; however, \nthe exact mechanisms by which this process is accomplished are still unclear. To address this \nquestion, an audiovisual Stroop task was used in combination with simultaneous fNIRS-EEG and \ninhibitory neurostimulation. The results indicate a causal role of the DLPFC in the implementation \nof cognitive control in high-conflict situations via two mechanisms: Suppression of distracting \nsensory input (auditory cortex) or amplification of stimulus processing with an activation shift \ntowards task-relevant areas (visual system). These data give important insights into the mechanisms \nby which the DLPFC accomplishes conflict adaptation.  \n \nIntroduction:  C o g n i t i v e  control is a prerequisite for successful, goal-oriented behavior. Specifically, cognitive \ncontrol is needed when goal-irrelevant prepotent information interferes with goal-relevant information in the selection \nof behavior, causing response conflict. This is typically the case on incongruent trials of classical Stroop tasks, leading \nto increased reaction times and/or error rates (“Stroop effect”). Interestingly, subsequent to high-conflict trials, \nbehavioral Stroop effects are often reduced. This so-called conflict-adaptation or “Gratton effect” is assumed to be the \nresult of processing adjustments in cognitive control putatively accomplished by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \n(DLPFC); however, the exact mechanisms by which conflict-adaptation is achieved are still partly unclear. In the \npresent study, we implemented an audiovisual Stroop task in combination with non-invasive brain stimulation and \nsimultaneous fNIRS-EEG to 1) directly test the hypothesis of a causal role of the DLPFC in cognitive control (by \ntemporarily inhibiting the DLPFC via rTMS before task performance); and 2) further elucidate the mechanisms \nunderlying cognitive control across different sensory modalities.  \nMethods: Our Stroop paradigm (adapted from Egner & Hirsch, 2005) comprised simultaneously presented pictures \nand spoken names of actors and politicians. Depending on the task block, participants had to indicate whether they \nsaw or heard the face or name of a politician or an actor. In congruent trials, both stimuli (auditory/visual) belonged \nto the same response category; in incongruent trials, they belonged to different categories. During this task, \nsimultaneous fNIRS-EEG measurements were conducted to monitor activation levels in the frontal cortex (fNIRS) as \nwell as task-relevant sensory areas (auditory cortex: fNIRS; fusiform face area/FFA: EEG/N170). Additionally, the \neffects of inhibitory theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over the right DLPFC were assessed, in order to test the hypothesis \nof a causal involvement of the DLPFC in conflict adaptation. A total of 31 healthy individuals participated in two \nmeasurement sessions (one following placebo and one following inhibitory TBS, counterbalanced across participants). \nResults: Behavioral data suggest a reduced Stroop effect following incongruent trials (“Gratton effect”), but only after \nplacebo stimulation, i.e., with an intact DLPFC. The results furthermore indicate two key mechanisms via which \nconflict adaptation was accomplished: For the auditory cortex, distracting sensory input seemed to be suppressed in \nhigh conflict–high control situations (i.e., on incongruent trials following incongruent trials). In contrast, within the \nvisual system (FFA) an amplification/prolongation of stimulus processing seemed to occur in high-conflict situations, \nwith an activation shift towards task-relevant sensory areas.  \nConclusion:  The DLPFC is causally involved in implementing cognitive control to reduce response conflict. Thereby, \ndifferent mechanisms are applied in auditory vs. visual cortices. \n \nReferences \n1.Egner, T., Hirsch, J.

This study aims to assess the replicability of fNIRS data in neurodevelopmental \npopulations, with particular attention to neurodiverse children.  \n \nIntroduction:  Test-retest reliability quantifies the consistency of a measurement across repeated measures , which is \ncrucial  to confidently investigate  the relationship between our measure and other variables of interest, thereby \ninfluencing the validity of the measure itself. Good reliability constitutes therefore one of the core principles in \nexperimental neuroscience , especially when studies results  will inform strategies of intervention for neurodivergent \nchild ren. Yet, despite the significant increase of fNIRS studies over the past years , reproducibility assessments , \nparticularly in studies with  developmental populations, is limited to two experimental works  (Blasi et al., 2014; \nGemignani  et al., 2023) . This study seeks to  assess the re producibility  of fNIRS data, focusing specifically on diffuse \noptical tomography (DOT)  implemented in a VR set -up, in neurodiverse children . \n \nMethods: Sixty neurodiverse children aged 3 to 6, including children  with ASD, ADHD, and low -empathy traits, are \ninvited to participate in a Go/NoGo task in the ToddlerLab Cave  – a child -friendly Virtual Reality (VR) Environment. \nBrain activity from  the frontal cortex , which has previously been implicated in inhibition tasks , is recorded using the \nLUMO  DOT system (Gowerlabs Ltd.) . Each child performs the task twice, with a gap of 1 to 2 weeks between \nsessions.  Test-retest reliability between the testing sessions is assessed  (Blasi et al., 2014) .  \n \nResults: Data collection is ongoing. So far , nine children have \ncompleted both testing sessions  -  3 children with ASD, 3 \nchildren with or at elevated likelihood  of ADHD, and 3 \nneurotypical children. Compliance to equipment  seems to be \ninfluenced by ASD symptom severity . On the contrary , \nneurotypical and ADHD children  demonstrated high \ncompliance . We will investigate  the difference between neural \nactivations in go and no -go trials and its consistency across \nsessions  at both  a group and individual level  (Fig.).  \n \nConclusion:  This study systematically assesses the \nreproducibility of fNIRS data in neurodiverse children. The \nintegration of VR and DOT will yield new insights at both \nbehavioral and neural levels. Understanding the reliability of our \nfindings is crucial for confidently design ing intervention , clinical \npractice, and the advancement of research  in ecological settings .

    "Shining a light on the neural underpinnings of early \nnumber word learning \n \nNina Jost1, Stephanie Bugden2, Samuel Forbes1, Anna A. Matejko1 \n1 Department of Psychology, Durham University, Upper Mountjoy, South Road, Durham, UK  \n2 Department of Psychology, University of Winnipeg, 515 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg Canada  \nNina.jost@durham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Early understanding of number words is crucial for future maths skills. However, it remains unclear \nhow the brain supports the acquisition of number words. This study is the first to use fN IRS to investigate \nconceptual changes in children’s number word comprehension. We will use a behavioural measure (Give -N-Task) \nto determine children’s number -knower level. Following this, we will use fNIRS while children complete the \nnumber word quantity mapping task to compare brain activity across knower -levels. We predict that younger \nchildren will exhibit activation in language regions, whereas older and more experienced children will \ndemonstrate activation in numeracy areas.  \n \nFunctional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non -invasive , child -friendly and motion -tolerant  neuro imaging \ntechnique that uses near -infrared light to measure changes in  the concentration of  oxygenated and deoxygenated \nhaemoglobin in the brain.  For the first time, this study will investigate how conceptual changes in preschool \nchildren’s number word learning are reflected in the brain using fNIRS. We aim to uncover novel insights into the \nneural mechanisms underpinning children’s early numeracy skills, shining  a light on whether the acquisition of \nthese fundamental numerical concepts leads to changes in neural representations of number words. Previous \nresearch has suggested that acquiring the meaning of number words during preschool years is crucial as it lays the \nfoundation for future maths learning (Pixner et al., 2018). The Cardinality Principle (CP) states that the last \nnumber reached in a count list represents the size of the whole set  (Sarnecka & Wright, 2013; Spaepen et al., \n2018) . Children begin to learn the exact meaning of small numbers (e.g., two = **), by learning each number one -\nby-one until they eventually become CP -knowers. Behavioural studies have significantly advanced our \nunderstanding of children's early mathematical development. However, it still remains unknown how different \nbrain networks support the acquisition of the CP and if there is a developmental shift in  brain regions supporting \nchildren’s number word processing. Knowing how different brain networks are involved in this conceptual shift \nis important, as this will help us gain a deeper understanding of the neurocognitive process supporting this \ndevelopmenta l milestone.  \n \nPreliminary behavioural and neuroimaging data will be collected from preschoolers from the age of 2 in the North \nEast of England to capture this crucial developmental window of children’s number word learning. We will use a \nwell-validated number task (Give -N-Task) to determine children‘s number -knower level (one -, two -, three -, four - \nand CP -knowers). Following this, children will wear an fNIRS cap while completing a passive version of a  number \nword -quantity mapping task to compare brain activity across know er-levels to examine neurobiological \ndifferences in number word knowledge.   \n \nBased  on previous findings with adults and older children, we expect to see bilateral intra -parietal networks \nindicating an understanding of numeracy in the CP -knowers. However, in younger children who do not know the \nmeaning of words, we expect to see activation in the left inferior frontal and temporo -parietal language regions. \nThis will add significantly to the literature as no study to date has used fNIRS to examine whether there might be \na shift in brain regions as children learn number words.  Preliminary data will be collected in the North East of \nEngland, an area where poor numeracy skills are prevalent compared to other regions in the UK. Using a multi -\nmethod approach that uses well -validated behavioural measures as well as novel neuroimaging techniques \n(fNIRS) will provide evidence about children's number word learning from both behavioural and neural \nperspectives. Further, examining number word learning in the North East of England, where children significantly \nlag behind their peers in the South, allows us to examine children's number word learning in a population that \nfaces significant barriers in meeting early le arning milestones , holding  promise for the early identification of \nmathematical difficulties . This proposed research, therefore, has both the potential to impact the development of \ninterventions for early identification and uncover the neurobiological underpinnings of children’s early numerical \nabilities. Data collection for this study will begin  in the spring, and preliminary data will be presented at the \nconference.  120 of 398",
    "Specificity of NIRS-based neurofeedback -  \nEffects of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) vs.  \ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) training  \nin highly-impulsive individuals \n \nAnn-Christine Ehlis, Betti Schopp, Masako Nagashima,  \nJustin Huda k, Beatrix Barth & Andreas J. Fallgatter  \nDepartment of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Tuebingen Center for Mental Health (TüCMH), Calwerstr. 14, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany \n German Center for Mental Health (DZPG), Germany \nAnn-Christine.Ehlis@med.uni-tuebingen.de \n \nAbstract:  Neurofeedback (NF) is a method of non-invasive neuromodulation. For the treatment of \nADHD, different protocols have been proposed, with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and \ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) most frequently targeted. In the present study, we directly \ncompared both protocols in highly-impulsive individuals using eight sessions of fNIRS-NF. We \nfound significant correlations between learning of self-regulation within the DLPFC and IFG, but \nnot a temporal cortex control area. Also, more efficient frontal neural processing during an n-back \ntask occurred following IFG (and partly also DLPFC) NF. We conclude that fNIRS-based frontal \nNF elicits specific neurocognitive changes; however, the current setup did not specifically target the \nIFG vs. DLPFC region.  \n \nIntroduction:  Neurofeedb ack (NF) is a method of non-invasive neuromodulation enabling individuals to self-regulate \ncertain aspects of their own brain physiology. While electroencephalography (EEG) is the technique most frequently \nemployed for NF – especially in applied clinical contexts – more recently, hemodynamic methods such as functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been proposed as novel \nNF tools to train self-regulation of circumscribed brain areas. For the (complementary) treatment of attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), different frontal lobe protocols have been proposed, with the inferior frontal \ngyrus (IFG) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) most frequently targeted. In the present study, we directly \ncompared both strategies and investigated the effects of fNIRS-based IFG vs. DLPFC training in highly-impulsive, \nhealthy adults. \nMethods: Each  participant  conducted eight sessions of NF training following one of three protocols (randomized \ngroup assignment): 1) DLPFC-NF (n=18), 2) IFG-NF (n=19), 3) NF of a control area within the temporal cortex \n(n=20) that was previously shown to be maximally unrelated to the two frontal lobe ROIs during performance of a \nclassical Stroop task. As a study population, highly impulsive healthy adults were targeted as a subclinical model for \nADHD, in order to avoid medication effects and psychiatric comorbidities often present within this clinical group. As \noutcome measures, we assessed NF learning rates, changes in impulsivity symptoms and effects on two neurocognitive \ntasks related to either (primarily) the DLPFC (n-back task) or IFG (Go-NoGo task); thereby, we focused on training-\nrelated changes in behavioral data as well as brain activity (fNIRS).  \nResults: We observed comparable learning rates in all three training groups (but overall less difficulty regulating the \ntemporal cortex as compared to both frontal regions of interest/ROIs). Moreover, we found significant correlations \nbetween learning of self-regulation within the DLPFC and IFG ROIs, irrespective of the actual training regimen. \nRegarding pre/post testing, we also found a specific decrease in working memory-related DLPFC activation following \nIFG (and – statistically less robust – also DLPFC) NF while behavioral working memory measures were stable or \neven improved for the post-measurement, indicating a more efficient neural processing following particularly IFG NF \ntraining. And finally, different correlations were observed between NF learning parameters and task-related activation \nchanges from pre- to post-testing.  \nConclusion:  We conclude that fNIRS-based frontal lobe NF training can elicit specific neurocognitive changes in \nterms of more efficient neuronal processing. However, the current fNIRS-based NF setup did not specifically target \nthe IFG vs. DLPFC region. Instead co-activation of both areas seemed to have occurred that was, however, unrelated \nto regulation efforts of the control area outside the frontal lobe. This may be due to limited spatial resolution of fNIRS \nor the fact that the DLPFC and IFG are putatively both part of a “regulation network” underlying NF training efforts.  \n121 of 398",
    "MRI co-registration of infant fNIRS data: comparing the use \nof individual MRIs versus age -specific MRI templates.  \n \nAuthors: D’Avino, G.,1, 2 Forbes, S.  H.,1 Wijeakumar, S.,3 Eggebrecht, A. T.,4 Magnotta , A, V.,5 Singh, V.,6 \nTiwari, M.,6 Kumar, A.,6 and Spencer, J. P.2  \n1Durham University, Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham,UK. .  \n2School of Psychology, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK   \n3School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK  \n4Washington University in St. Louis, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, Missouri .  \n5United States Department of Radiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA  \n6Community Empowerment Lab, Lucknow, India  \ne-mail: giulia.d’avino@ durham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  fNIRS is a useful tool to investigate infant brain development. A limitation of fNIRS is \nspatially localising the signal in the cortex. A solution is MRI co -registration. Yet, research has not \ncompared the use of individual versus template anatomy. 142 infants took part in an fNIRS and MRI \nsession in India. Four analyses were run: a channel -based analysis, an analysis with participants’ \nindividual MRIs, and two analyses using Indian and American age -specific templa tes. Results \nshowed the template -based registration yielded more significant clusters.  This seems due to \ndifferences in brain tissue properties across analyses, arguing for standardisation in infant fNIRS \nanalysis.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a novel and innovative neuroimaging \ntechnique which uses near -infrared light to measure changes in haemoglobin oxygenation in the brain. This \ntechnique is useful when investigating brain development in infan cy as it allows infants to move freely. However, a n \nissue with fNIRS is the need to spatially localise the signal in the cortex. One approach to overcom ing this challenge \nis co -registration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, also referred to as image reconstruction) to gain structural \ninformation in analysis. Typically, co -registration uses an atlas – a brain template  – but  it can also be used with \nindividual anatomy (e.g., a participant’s MRI scan). Yet, little research has compared the use of individual versus \ntemplate anatomy in infant fNIRS analysis.  \nMethods:  We ran four different analyses on the same data from a sample  of fNIRS data from a large -scale \nstudy  in India. A total of 142 participants, 72 6 -month -olds and 70 9 -month -olds, took part in an fNIRS session with \na visual working memory preferential looking task and an MRI session. The co -registration analyses were run using \nthe analysis pipeline by Forbes et al . (2021)  and the channel -based analysis followed a similar protocol but without \nco-registration. First, a channel -based analysis (using only  the fNIRS data) was run as a baseline analysis. Second, \nan analysis reconstructed with participants’ individual MRIs was conducted. The third and fourth analyses were run \nwith age -specific template s developed from an Indian sample (same cohort as participants  Wijeakumar et al ., 2023 ) \nand a United States (US) sample (Dean et al, 2014).  \nResults: Findings show that the analysis with age -specific templates found the most significant clusters , \nfollowed by the individual MRI analysis and lastly, the channel -based analysis. Additional analyses were run to \nfurther explore the results. This included decreasing the cluster size to 105 voxels (a less conservative threshold) and \ninvestigating brain tis sue properties. We found that the templates had double the number of clusters than the \nindividual MRIs analys is. When examining the brain tissue prope rties, we found that both templates had more grey \nmatter (GM) and less skull  whereas  the individual MRIs had more skull . This is meaningful as the different \nproperties may lead to differences in fNIRS signal strength during image reconstruction.  The combination of more \nGM and less skull in the templates pushes the fNIRS signal deeper into the brain allowing the signal to spread, \nleading to more significant clusters. The skull absorbs near -infrared light; consequently, the presence of more skull \nin the indiv idual MRIs may reduce signal strength leading to fewer significant clusters.   \nConclusion:  This work shows how various analysis approaches may lead to differing results, suggesting \nthe need for a standardised approach in infant fNIRS analysis.   \n     \n122 of 398",

In this \nwork , we are inviting neurodiverse children aged 3 to 6 to complete a go/no -go task in a VR \nenvironment while measuring their frontal  activity with the new LUMO  system (Gowerlabs Ltd. ). \nWe aim to share our experience and insights to guide future research, making science more inclusive \nand benefiting all stakeholders.  \n \nIntroduction:  Recent technological advancements in fNIRS have undoubtedly enriched our understanding of the \ndeveloping brain. However, the suitability of these cutting -edge technologies for all populations remains debatable . \nFor instance, neurodiverse children may experience sensory processing issues that could hinder  their ability to wear \nthe fNIRS cap. As a c onsequen ce, there is a risk of inadvertently selecting only participants who are comfortable with \nour equipment, potentially compromising the generalizability of our results.  While the technological aspect excels, \nthe human element is frequently overlooked. Nevertheless, ensuring children's compliance is one of the most important \nfactors in ensuring  good quality data in developmental researc h (Baek  et al, 2023) . In collaboration with families, \nresearchers, and Gowerlabs, our partner company, we have dedicated efforts to assess and customi se diffuse optical \ntomography (DOT) and Virtual Reality (VR) setups to suit the needs of neurodiverse children.  \n \nMethods: We are inviting  60 neurodiverse children aged 3 to 6, either \nneurotypical or neurodiverse (ASD, ADHD, low -empathy traits) , to participate \nin a Go/NoGo task within the new ToddlerLab Cave —a child -friendly Virtual \nReality Environment  (Fig). Brain activity in the frontal area is recorded using \nthe innovative LUMO DOT system (Gowerlabs Ltd.) . Each child performs the \ntask twice, with a gap of 1 to 2 weeks between sessions. Children’ caregivers \ncomplete a questionnaire pre and post testing to identify challenges associated \nwith the VR/DOT testing set -up. Collaboratively, with the researchers, \nadjustments are made to tailor the environment to suit each child, thereby \nenhancing compliance and the quality of data collection.  \n \nResults: Data collection is ongoing . So far , 9 children who completed both testing sessions. This group comprises 3 \nchildren with ASD who did not comply with the equipment, alongside 3 children with or at elevated likelihood  of \nADHD and 3 neurotypical children who responded well to the experimental setup . We will provide our testimony and \nobservations regarding the factors we identified as improving data collection and children’s compliance. These include \nthe necessity of breaks, videos of the equipment to prepare participants  for the testing session, the use of rewards, the \ntiming of experiments and gear usage, adjustments of the cap to accommodate the child ’s comfort , and establishing a \nconnection between the child and researchers, particularly when working with non -verbal children.  \n \nConclusion:  Thanks to a collaboration between researchers, industry, children, and caregivers, we are tailoring  VR \nand DOT technologies to meet the needs of neurodiverse children. Our aim is to provide guidance for the field, \nparticularly focusing on improving research practices and laying the foundation for studying atypical development in \necological contexts  with fNIRS .

While prior research focused on singular perspectives, \nwe investigated  the dynamic gradient of neural synchrony in evolving states of shared reality. Dyads \nof participants  (N=34), with different  views on student council candidates, will interact, with the \nobjective of reach ing an agreement on one candidate . During the interaction , participants' brain \nresponse will be measured using fNIRS . We will analyze neural synchrony within different regions \nto find patterns associated with different states  of shared reality . We expect to find increased neural \nsynchrony in social cognition areas.  \n \nIntroduction:  Shared reality theory suggests that individuals in  social interactions share a common reality that is co -\nconstructed and maintained by mutual understanding and communication . Past studies  found that individuals often \nadjust their perceptions and narratives to resonate with those of their audience, fosteri ng a shared understanding of \nreality.  Most of these studies either explored behavioral or subjective measures, while n euroimaging studies in th is \nfield primarily focused on participants in static states of shared reality, whether in agreement or disagreeme nt. In the \ncurrent study, we explore the dynamic of neural synchrony by testing neural synchronization in the process of \ntransitioning from disagreement to agreement.  \n \nMethods: Sixty -eight native Hebrew -speaking participants, aged 21 -32, from Tel -Aviv Univ ersity, were recruited via \nSona System and social media. They were right -handed with no neurological issues, paired based on their \ndisagreement on a topic they had not previously discussed. The stimuli consisted of four 4:15 -minute videos featuring \nstudent  council candidates, scripted to present different agendas in a general manner. Following an initial online survey \nwhere participants viewed and summarized these videos, they were invited to the laboratory in pairs . The pairs were \nselected such that they d id not agree  on the best candidate . Upon arriving at the lab, participants watched the \ncandidates ’ videos  again, and then participated in  a semi -structured discussion, with participants tasked to reach a \nconsensus on one candidate for the student council position. Afterwords participants viewed the candidates’ videos \nonce more. During th e entire interaction , participants' neural responses wer e measured using fNIRS (functional Near -\nInfrared Spectroscopy) and heart rate  variability using a polarH10 monitor, while  their interaction was recorded via \nvideo cameras.  Participants’ engagement and preferences for each candidate were recorded on a 1 -9 scale throughout \nthe viewings and following the last viewing participants filled Shared Reality for Target  (SRT)  and Quality of \nInteraction  (QOI)  questionnaires.  Data analysis included Inter -Subject Correlation  (ISC)  to examine neural synchrony \nbetween participants during the two viewing sessions , focusing on the chosen candidates , as well as c orrelation \nanalyses  between shared reality and  the physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures . Region of interests \nincluded primary auditory  and visual cortices , inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG), prefrontal cortex ( PFC), and temporal -\nparietal junction ( TPJ). \n \nResults: Behavioral ratings suggested  that the average d SRT scores of  the chosen candidate (Mean = 5.589, SD = \n1.049) were higher than the scores of the candidate not chosen (Mean = 4.563, SD = 1.323) . In our preliminary analysis \nof the neuroimaging data,  we found that  high order brain areas (TPJ and PFC) show ed increased synchronization for \nthe second viewing of the chosen candidate.  \n \nConclusion : Our preliminary results \nsuggest that shared reality is reflected \nin neural synchronization.  \n \n124 of 398",
    "First Experiences Integrating fNIRS and Virtual Reality  \nKasey Forsythe1, Hendrik Santosa2, Theodore Huppert3 \n1Department of Bioengineering,  2Department of Radiology , 3Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  \nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA  \nKlf102@pitt.edu  \n \nAbstract. Integrating non -invasive methods of neuroimaging  like functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)  with \nVirtual Reality (VR) could give researchers an opportunity to collect data in environments that  mimic real -world \nsettings, while maintaining a controlled environment for collecting reliable data . In this study, we used fNIRS  to \ninvestigate the feasibility and reproducibility of recording brain activity during a VR task to assess spatial working \nmemory. Although, brain activity was recorded successfully from four participants, our initial experiences with \nintegrating these technologies highlighted  challenges like susceptibility to motion sickness and participants’ \nexperience with VR, which will need to be considered when designing future tasks.  \n \nIntroduction . Integrating Virtual Reality (VR) with brain imaging provides opportunities to collect data of cognitive \ntasks that more accurately represent the ‘real world’ than what can traditionally be collected in the lab. While \nneuroimaging studies testing simple cognitive tasks provide important data in advancing the field  and benefit from a \ncontrolled environment , they are limited in their scope of providing information about cognition in real -world events.  \nIntegrating VR into neuroimaging studies allows researchers to collect data from subjects immersed in environments \nthat mimic real world cognitive decision -making whilst still being able to provide reliable data from a controlled \nenvironment. VR has had an increasing role in clinical and cognitive research. Expanding research done with VR into \nneuroimaging allows researcher s to better understand brain activity during tasks proven to have clinical significance. \nAs Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)  is portable and not as sensitive to movement as other methods of \nbrain imaging, it is a desirable method for integrating with VR.  \n \nMethods.  \nFNIRS . To collect brain activity during the task, we used NIRX  NIRSPORT2. 42 \nchannels were distributed across bilateral frontal and sensorimotor brain regions. \nFig. 1 shows the sensitivity of the probes overlying Brodmann areas. In this \nexperiment, we used the wearable fNIRS system. The participant wore the Oculus \nMeta Quest 2 to run the VR program. The headset was designed to integrate with \nthe Oculus headset to limit mechanical and optical interference.  \nBox Task . We built a program in Unreal Engine to perform a spatial working \nmemory box task where the user was placed in a room with 16 boxes . The user \ninitially started in a survey period where they clicked on every box to find the 3 \nreward boxes. When pressed, a box would either turn green to indicate it was a \nreward or turn red to indicate it was not a reward. The user would then go \nthrough a  30 second baseline period where the boxes became invisible followed \nby a retrieval period where they are spawned at a random location in the room, \nall the box's colors are reset to the default, and they are given 30 seconds to find \nthe 3 reward boxe s. In a level, the participant goes through a survey period and \nthen alternating rest and retrieval periods for five trials. We recorded the \nparticipant’s brain activity for two levels.  \n \nResults. We recorded fNIRS data during the VR task with n=4 to find \npreliminary results. Brain activity changes were estimated between the Survey \nand the Retrieval periods compared to the baseline. The fNIRS results are \nshown in Fig. 2 This figure showing the t-value ( q-val < 0.05) for HbO2 \nchanges.   \n \nConclusion . While integrating VR with neuroimaging presents challenges \nwith experimental design, we have found ways to overcome such challenges. \nIntegrating fNIRS and Virtual Reality shows promise for advancing the field \nof neuroimaging.   \n Fig 2.  fNIRS activation (t -statistic) \nmaps comparing survey  and \nretrieval periods  compared to the \nbaseline condition . \n125 of 398",
    "Cognitive domains classification using fNIRS \n \nHendrik Santosa1, Theodore Huppert2 \n \n1Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \n2Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \nhendrik.santosa@pitt.edu , huppert1@pitt.edu   \n \nAbstract:  We propose to map brain signals onto the ‘cognitive domain ’ underlying complex brain \nfunctions rather than task themselves. Specifically, we propose to utilize  a projection of brain signals \nusing spatial maps defined by the six key cognitive domains defined by the DSM -V (i.e., language, \nperceptual -motor, executive function, complex attention, social cognition, and learning and memory.  \n \nIntroduction:  Imagine that there was a way to measure someone’s brain signals during a cognitive test and be able \nto give them indexed composite score of cognition along several dimensions. We will use six cognitive domains which \nadopted from the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -V) [1]. Each of six \ncognitive domains has several subdomains [2]: (i) language: object naming, word finding, fluency, grammar and \nsyntax, and receptive language; (ii) perceptual -motor: visual perception, visuoconstructional , reasoning, perceptual -\nmotor, coordination; (iii) executive function: Planning, decision -making, working memory, responding to feedback, \ninhabitation, and flexibility; (iv) complex attention: sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, \nprocessing speed; (v) social cognition: recognition of emotions, theory of mind, and insight; and (vi) learning and \nmemory: free recall, cued recall, recognition memory, sematic and autobiographical, long -term memory, and implicit \nlearning.  \n \nMethods: We propose a paradigm shifting analysis approach where instead \nof using fNIRS to estimate brain activation pattern for a specific task, we \nutilize our existing knowledge of common patterns of brain activity  for \nsimilar tasks done in fMRI to create a set of testable [null] hypotheses. The \nquestions will be “Is the pattern of fNIRS  measured [not] consistent with what \nis expected from (e.g.) the general category of working memory tasks ?” \nNotably, this approach abandons  the conventional “brain imaging” approach \nwhere one estimates the statistical heatmap of brain activity for specific \ntemporal components of a task. Instead, we used the existing fMRI maps to \nperform analysis using “activation patterns -of-interest” . Fig. 1 illustrate s the \nresponse  from N -back task , wherein  the ‘blue’ condition shows a higher \nresponse in social cognition , attributed to processing people’s faces, \ncompared to the ‘shape’ condition  (red) , which exhibits a similar learning \nmemory response.  \n \nResults: We investigated classification using LDA for all tasks : working memory  (zero-back vs two-back), language \n(math vs story ), and social  (mental vs random ). The accuracy from the best performance at the  scan level using leave -\none-trial out was 87.5% for working memory, 91.6% for language , and 80% for social tasks.  \n \nConclusion:  We utilized  tasks from HCP project , which  already ha s many available fNIRS dataset. These tasks  \nencompass all cognitive domains outlined in DSM -V.

    "NeuroDOT: an Extensible Set of Tools for Optical Brain \nMapping in Matlab and Python \nEmma Speh1, Yash Thacker1, Ari Segel1, Dan Marcus1, Muriah D. Wheelock1, Adam T. Eggebrecht1 \n1Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine 4515 McKinley Ave, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA \nespeh@wustl.edu   \n \nAbstract: NeuroDOT is a Matlab and Python-based toolbox for functional near infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) with functions, pipelines, and training \ntutorials for data pre-processing, anatomical light modeling, image reconstruction, analysis, and \nvisualization. Adapting the NeuroDOT toolbox to Python addresses challenges of fNIRS and DOT \nprocessing including costly software licenses (Matlab and necessary add-on toolboxes) and \ncompatibility with multiple data formats (e.g., NIFTI, GIFTI, NIRS, and SNIRF) and other widely \nused neuroimaging tools also developed in Python. © 2024 The Author(s). \n \nIntroduction: Processing pipelines for functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography \n(DOT) data pose many challenges1. Costly software licenses (e.g., Matlab) and a tendency to develop group-specific \npipelines prevent the adoption of standardized practices for data processing, as are being leveraged in the fMRI \ncommunity2. Another challenge of fNIRS and DOT toolbox development is the need for compatibility with multiple \ndata formats (e.g.,SNIRF, BIDS, NIRS, NIfTI, GIFTI, 4dfp, etc.) and a wide variety of commercially available \nsystems (e.g., GowerLabs, NIRx, etc.).  \n \nMethods:  NeuroDOT is a self-contained toolbox that contains individual functions and scripts for fNIRS and DOT \ndata processing and visualization. NeuroDOT provides tools for pre-processing, data quality analysis, head modeling, \nimage reconstruction, and post processing with statistical analyses, removing the need to combine multiple packages \nto perform these tasks. NeuroDOT contains functions for the conversion between various data formats including \nvolumetric data relevant to both the fNIRS and fMRI communities (e.g. SNIRF, NIRS, NIFTI, 4dfp, and BIDS).  In \naddition to the utility provided by NeuroDOT, we have aimed to provide a variety of shared DOT datasets, in both \nNeuroDOT’s native *.mat format and  *.snirf, spanning common neuroimaging paradigms such as retinotopy, \nlanguage, and resting state. Shared data are available to download from the NeuroDOT NITRC page \n(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/neurodot ). \n \nResults: Documentation for efficient training for the novice and expert user is provided in the form of tutorial \nPowerPoints and Jupyter notebooks accompanying Matlab and Python scripts, respectively. We have aimed to  \npromote modernization of the growing components of NeuroDOT by refactoring the toolbox in Python with enhanced \ndevelopment tools, shared data repositories, and data format standardization relevant to both optical and fMRI fields \nand have enhanced the support for our community of users and developers with expanded documentation and tutorials \ndevelopers with expanded documentation and tutorials. \n \nConclusions: NeuroDOT supplies the fNIRS community with a highly efficient, intuitive, and extensible toolbox with \nshared tools for fMRI-comparable high fidelity optical brain mapping3. Functions are written as building blocks for \nworkflows, so groups can build their own pipelines. We aim to  promote modernization of the growing components of \nNeuroDOT by refactoring the toolbox in Python with enhanced development tools, data format standardization \nrelevant to both optical and fMRI fields and enhanced the support for NeuroDOT users and developers with expanded \ndocumentation and tutorials. O pen-source software is essential for standardization of processing and accessibility of \nthe NeuroDOT toolbox to new users. The next  step for this project is launching Optical-imaging XNAT-enabled \nInformatics (OXI), an XNAT-based platform for data sharing, processing, and collaboration on the cloud. \n \nReferences:   \n[1] AT Eggebrecht et al.

    "Emotion regulation in bipolar d isorder: A bimodal EEG-\nfNIRS study using an emotional Stroop task \n \nInès Tahir*1, Anne Planat -Chrétien1, Dr Arnaud Pouchon2, Dr Antoine Bertrand2, Dr Mircea Polosan2  \n \n1. Univ. Grenoble Alpes, CEA -Leti F-38000 Grenoble, France  \n2. Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Pôle Psychiatrie et Neurologie, Centre Expert en Troubles Bipolaires, F -38000 Grenoble, France  \n*ines.tahir@cea.fr  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigates the impact of emotional dysregulation on cognitive executive \nfunction in bipolar disorder (BD)  by employing a system coupling electroencephalography (EEG) \nand functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during an emotional Stroop task. The ongoing \nresearch involves  82 subjects divided into bipolar patients (BP)  type I, type II, first -degree relatives, \nand healthy controls (HC).  Preliminary results highlight behavioral differences between BP s and \nHCs, suggesting the potential interest of combining the event-related potential (ERP) and  block-\nrelated -hemodynamic answer (BRH) for classification purposes and for deeper investigation into \nthe cognitive functioning of BD. \n \nIntroduction:  Bipolar disorder  (BD)  is a chronic mood disorder characterized by thymic (depressive/  (hypo )manic ) \nepisodes  interspersed with intercritical (euthymic) periods . Manifesting primarily as BD type I or II, this disorder \ninvolves an emotional dysregulation , even during intercritical  periods . We posited that this emotional dysregulation \nmay differentially interfere with executive  cognitive  functioning depending on  the BD  type. Using an emotional \nStroop  task1, we aimed  to distinguish  bipolar patients (BP) type I and II , first-degree relatives (F - family), healthy \ncontrol s (HC) based on electrical and hemodynamic brain activity recorded with a commercial helmet combining \nelectroencephalography (EEG) and functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during task execution . \n \nMethods: The study  currently included  21 BP s type I, 25 type II, 11 F and 25 HC s. The protocol encompassed  a \nresting phase, a training block with neutral images , and 6 experimental blocks of valence images : 2 neutral , 2 negative, \n2 positive, interspersed with resting breaks. Participants identified  colors of image frames  (red or green)  while wearing \nan EEG -fNIRS  cap with 64 EEG electrodes  and 6 fNIRS channels  (4 sources, 4 detectors) , synchronized via software \ntriggers. Initially , we conducted  a behavioral analysis on the response time and accuracy to validate the protocol ’s \nrelevance. Afterwards , we preprocess ed EEG data using  an adapted  artefact subspace reconstruction2 (ASR ) with \nparameters learned during  a calibration period. We extract ed event-related potential s (ERP)  per block type . fNIRS \nsignals w ere preprocess ed with band -pass filtering and block-related -hemodynamic answer s (BRH) were computed \nper block type. To enhance  the signal -to-noise ratio and ERPs/BRHs significance, we compute d a grand average of \nthe signals for each group within  region s identified  by anatomic al region s or based on  connectivity pre -analysis.   \n \nResults: The protocol revealed  prolonged response times in BPs (particularly  type I) compared to HC s and differences \nbetween negative and the other  cond itions for BP s (particularly  type II), suggesting an impact of negative emotional \nvalence  on BPs executive cognitive function . However, no significant distinctions in task accuracy or response time \nemerged between  BPs and F, and among bipolar types . ERPs analysis , employing statistical tests on time windows , \ndisclosed significant group differences on brain regions (for example, significant differences between groups were \nobserved on an occipital positive potential s around  250 and 450  ms, p <0.05) . Preliminary fNIRS results were \npromising and extended analysis will be pursued, taking into account the extra cerebral compartment contribution .   \n \nConclusion:  Our f indings indicated notable behavioral distinctions between BPs and HCs. The results from ERPs and \nBHRs have enable d group differentiation and expose d an impact of emotional stimuli on brain response . Going \nforward, we intend to employ feature extraction from these ER Ps and BRHs for classification purposes.  \n \nReferences  \n1. Quan, S., Wang, Z. & Liu, Y.

Children with ADHD ben efit from movement during cognitively demanding tasks due , \nin part,  to its  enhancement of left DLPFC activity .  \nIntroduction:  Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) struggle with inattention, impulsivity \nand often hyperactivity, and these challenges have, in part, been attributed to hypofrontality —a state of diminished \ncerebral blood flow in the PFC and correlated with executive dysfunction  [1]. However,  hyperactivity may play  a \ndeliberate and functional role in promoting  attention among those with ADHD.  Specifically, children with ADHD \nhave been shown to upregulate their gross motor activity during cognitively demanding tasks to augment prefrontal \ncortical hypoactivation, serving to enhance executive functioning . This research aimed to elucidate the \nneurocognitive impact of movement during executive functioning among children with ADHD.  \nMethods: Nine  participants comprised  the control group ( mean age=10.25 , female s=3) and 9 comprised the ADHD \ngroup ( mean age=10.13 , females=4). Participants completed a Stroop tas k while stationary and during a movement \ncondition ( desk cycling). The Stroop task was designed in Inquist and consisted of four task -blacks (50s each) with \nalternating 20s rest periods. Stroop outcome measures included reaction time (RT) and proportion correct.  Participants \nalso completed self -efficacy ratings pre-post each condition. Paired samples t -tests were conducted separately for \nADHD and control groups between movement and stationary conditions for each outcome measure. The fNIRS data \nwere collected with an 18-channel  system covering the prefrontal cortex  (NIRSport2, NIRx Medical Technologies, \nLLC) with a sampling rate of 10.2 Hz.  Data were preprocessed and analysed using Satori (v 2.04).  First, the raw data \nwas converted to changes in optical density and  corrected for motion artifacts. Next, the data was converted to changes \nin oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin and band -pass filtered ([0.01 0.5Hz]) to remove high -\nfrequency noise. GLM analysis w as conducted at the indivi dual level.  For each participant, the contrast of movement \n>s t a t i o n a r y  w a s  i n v e s t i g a t e d .  The specific region of interest (ROI) interrogated was the left dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex (DLPFC) represented by montage locations F1, F3, F5 (channels S4 -D2, S1 -D2, and S1 -D1, respectively).\nResults: Within the ADHD group, 78% of participants showed greater HbO during the movement condition compared  \nto the stationary condition  in the  left DLPFC . Stroop RT was superior in the movement condition compared to the \nstationary condition t(8)=1.91, p=.046, d= 1.00, while Stroop proportion correct was similar between conditions t(8) = \n0.05, p = .479. Self -efficacy for the Stroop task improved in the movement condition t(8)=2.14, p=.033, d=0.41 , \nwhereas it did not in the stationary condition t(8)=0.48, p=.323. Within the control group, 55% of participants  showed \ngreater HbO during the movement condition  compared to the stationary condition  in the left DLPFC . Stroop  proportion \ncorrect was superior in the movement condition compared to the  stationary condition t(8)= -1.88, p=.048, d=0.55 , \nwhile Stroop RT was similar between conditions t(8)=1.033, p=.166. Self -efficacy for the Stroop task did not improve \nin either the stationary or movement conditions (ts <1.42, ps >.096).  \nConclusion:  Children with and without ADHD benefit from movement during cognitively demanding tasks, with a \ngreater magnitude of benefit evident for those with ADHD. Emerging data suggest that movement promotes greater \nleft DLPFC activity, especially among those with ADHD, which is related to enhanced inhibitory control and self -\nefficacy.  129 of 398",

The temporal binding window (TBW) measures \naudiovisual temporal acuity and can be narrowed through simultaneity judgment training. The effects of training on \nspeech understanding and cortic al activity remain unclear. Twenty participants were randomized to receive either \nactive training or passive testing over 3 days. Trained participants demonstrated significant decreases in TBW \n(p=0.0008), which was associated with better auditory word reco gnition (p=0.036). Additionally, training increased \nresponses to auditory speech in the visual cortex via fNIRS. Altogether, we demonstrate that audiovisual training \nengenders changes in unisensory speech comprehension and cortical networks supporting speech processing. \nMain Text:  \nIntroduction:  Speech understanding is a complex phenomenon that involves the integration of auditory and visual \nspeech cues. The temporal binding window (TBW) is a measure of audiovisual temporal acuity, and our lab has \npreviously shown that the size of the TBW can be narrowed through training using a simultaneity judgment (SJ) task. \nHowever, the effects of SJ training on speech understanding and cortical organization remain unknown. We predict \nthat SJ training will narrow the TBW, and that this improvement  in audiovisual temporal acuity will result in \nimprovements in speech understanding and enhanced cortical speech processing.  \nMethods : Twenty adults participated in a computerized SJ training program over 3 days. TBW size, auditory -only, \nvisual -only, and audiovisual word recognition in noise were evaluated before and after SJ training. We also evaluated \nchanges in cortical activation pa tterns to auditory, visual, and audiovisual speech using functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS). To account for learning effects from repeated testing, participants were randomized to receive \neither SJ training and testing or SJ testing only.   \nResults : Following training, all participants demonstrated significant improvements in their TBW size (537 ms to 374 \nms; p=0.0008). Participants who completed SJ testing -only had no significant changes in TBW size (597 ms to 568 \nms; p=0.695). Auditory word recogn ition in noise also improved following SJ training (19.8% to 26.1%; p=0.058) \ncompared to SJ testing alone (20.8% to 14.4%; p=0.129). Finally, we found that decreases in TBW were significantly \ncorrelated with increases in auditory word recognition (p =0.036). Additionally, audiovisual training altered the neural \nrepresentation of auditory speech in the visual cortex.  \nRelationship Between Temporal Binding Window and Word Recognition in Noise\n*\na b c\n*\nConclusion:  Altogether, we demonstrate that the benefits of audiovisual temporal training can transfer to unisensory \nspeech comprehension and engender changes in cortical networks supporting speech processing. These findings \nhighlight the malleability of multisensory temporal integration and its role in speech understanding, and may guide \nrehabilitation for individuals with sensory impairments.  \nThe authors have no conflicts of interest or disclosures to report.  130 of 398",
    "The Neural Mechanisms of Order and Content Processing in \nPhonological Working Memory  \n \nJunker, A.1, Visibelli, E.2, Fló, A.2, Benavides -Varela, S.2,3 \n \n1Department of General Psychology, University of Padova, Via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy,  \n2Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisatio n, Via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy,  \n3Padova Neuroscience Center,  Via Orus 2/B , 3512 9, Padova , Italy. \nPresenting Author email address: annika.junker@unipd.it  \n \nAbstract:  Phonological working memory (pWM)  entails retaining the identity of the perceived \nstimuli (i.e., syllables) as well as their  sequential order . In this study, 34 Italian adults participated \nin a complex pWM  task, that included three levels of WM load and three conditions: no change, \norder change, and content change . Their brain activity was recorded using functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS).  The results show distinct neural activity patterns for content and order \nprocessing within pWM. They highlight the importance of parietal areas in order processing, \nespecially at a higher WM load. This study opens the door to applying a similar approach to other \npopulations , such as infants.  \n \nIntroduction:  Phonological working memory (pWM) is crucial for language processing as it enables  the maintenance  \nand manipulation of representations of speech sounds1. This process entails  retaining the identity of the perceived \nstimuli (i.e., phonemes, syllables) as well as their  sequential order. While order and content processing are crucial for \ncomplex tasks like  language comprehension, their neural correlates are debated2-4, especially under varying WM load.  \nThis study further investigates the neural m echanisms underlying order and content  processing in pWM and explores \ntheir modulation by task difficulty and WM demands . \n \nMethods: Thirty -four young Italian adults participated in a complex nonword recognition task, that included an  \nunrelated processing episode to suppress subvocal rehearsal processes. The task involved  three levels of WM load \n(five -, seven -, and nine -syllable nonwords) in three conditions: no  change, order change  (two syllables were \nexchanged) , and content change  (two syllables were replaced) . Brain activity was recorded in 78 channels over frontal, \ntemporal, and parietal  regions using a continuous wave NIRScout device . \n \nResults: In the no change  trials, t here was an effect of loa d on the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \n(DLPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior parietal lob ule (IPL), superior parietal lob ule (SPL),  and superior \ntemporal gyrus (STG) . This effect was driven by the retrieval in the DLPFC and IPL . When there was a change  in the \nsecond nonword , increased activation was found for content change compared to order change  at retrieval  across all \nROIs. WM load interacted with the type of change in inferior and superior parietal lobes, showing that the load effect \nwas driven by the order change condition  in these areas.  \n \nConclusion:  Our findings confirm the hypothesis of distinct neural activity patterns for content and order processing \nwithin pWM. They underline the importance of  both inferior and superior parietal areas , including regions like the \nsupramarginal gyrus  and intraparietal sulcus , in order processing, especially at a high WM load. Furthermore, this \nstudy confirms the usability of a complex WM task and fNIRS to detect  differences in order and content processing \nin pWM and opens the possibility of using a similar methodology in other populations, like infants.  \n \nReferences:  \n1.

This work \ndevelo ped teleoperation experiments of social tasks based on questions and answers during a dyadic \ninteraction between an operator and another individual . The operator's brain activity was recorded \nby a fNIRS device . Then, fNIRS features and performance metrics of 32 participants were analyzed \nfor neural profiling.  We found that the width of hemoglobin oxygenation  was greater in the high-\nperformance participants . \n \nIntroduction:  The remote environment perception influences the teleoperation of robots. This feature affects the \noperator's workload and mental state during social interaction with another individual . The operator's performance is \nrelated to the brain activity during the execution of teleoperated tasks due to the involvement of cognitive and affective \nprocesses . In this work, we decoded the neural profile of the operator's skills during teleoperated social tasks. This \nprofiler could be useful in human -robot interaction to estimate the level of the operator's trust. It could activate some \nautonomous control and cor rect the operator if necessary.  \n \nMethods: Thirty-two healthy subjects  participated in this experiment . The y wore a fNIR S devic e WOT -HS (Ne U \nCorporation) with 34 optodes to record brain activity . Then, t he hemoglobin oxygenation (Hbo) and deoxygenatio n \n(Hbr) signals were computed fro m fNIRS  data. Participant s teleoperate d a receptionis t robot (avatar ) to answer \nquestions (verbal section) and carry out action s (non-verbal section). Each participant performed a training sessio n \nand an evaluation session . Before the training session, participants took a workin g memory test (digit span memory \ntest). Then, the y memorized the behavioral rules  for 2 minutes an d were evaluated with a test for 1 minute. Next , \nparticipant s practice d the socia l task until they understood the procedure. The training session consisted o f 2 blocks \nof social tasks and 3 blocks of resting . Each social task block had 4 questions and a break betwee n them. The questioner \nasked these questions to the partici pant; then, the participant responded to them . Participants answered the questions \nusing the provided information located next to the touchscree n. The questio n lists were created randomly and were \nshown on a screen to th e questioner. After the training session, participants answere d the NASA -TLX  workload test. \nThis test rated six task load subscales (mental demand , physical demand, temporal demand,  performance satisfac tion, \neffort, frustration) and provided a n overall workload score. In the evaluation session , there was 1 block of social task s \nand 2 blocks of resting. In addition, participants watche d a black screen during the resting blocks of both session s.  \n \nResults: A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was trained for clus tering. It separated the participants into 2 groups , \nwhich we  searched to associate with low - and high -performance.  There were significant differences between \nperformance  groups of th e mean normalized operation time (p<0.01) and mean menta l demand score (p=0.04). Group  \n1 had a mea n normalized operation time greater than group  2. In addition, group  1 had a mean mental demand scor e \nlower than group  2. Thus, group s 1 and 2 could correspon d to low and high performance . Regarding fNIRS features, \nthere was a significant differenc e between groups of the mean Hbo -width (p=0.02). Group 1 reached a Hbo -width \nlower than group  2. Thus, fNIRS wave was longer for group  2. \n \nConclusion:  The neural profiling of participants during teleoperate d social tasks was approached by recording and \nanalyzin g brain activity by an fNIRS device. Participants were groupe d into two groups based on the clustering of a \nGMM. Then , these groups were related to low - and high -performance . High -performance participants achieved mean \noperation tim e lower, mean mental demand score greater, and Hbo -width greater than low -performance participants.  \nThus, the Hbo -width was a biomarker of the operator’s performanc e. \n \nAcknowledgments : This work was supported by JST Moonshot R&D Grant Number JP MJMS2011 (conducting the \nexperiment) and JSPS Bilateral Collaboration s Grant Number JPJSBP120245710 (data analysis ). 132 of 398",
    "Non-invasive blood flow calibration using a hybrid time -\nresolved NIRS/DCS system  \nDaniel Milej,1,2 Leena N. Shoemaker,1,2,3 Saeed Samaei,1,2 Graham Deller,1,2 Keith St \nLawrence1,2 \n1Imaging Program, Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada  \n2Department of Medical Biophysics, Western  University, London, Ontario, Canada  \n3School of Kinesiology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada  \nPresenting Author email address:  kstlaw@uwo.ca  \nAbstract:  This work presents a non-invasive method of calibrating diffuse correlation spectroscopy \n(DCS) by measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) using  time-resolved NIRS  (trNIRS)  and hypoxia.  \nA brief period of h ypoxia was used to cause a transient decrease in arterial oxygen saturation  that \nacts as a blood flow tracer. For validation, CBF was independently measured using the  MRI \nperfusion method , arterial spin labe lling (ASL).  Good linear correlation was observed between CBF  \nvalues from trNIRS  and ASL . Using hybrid trNIRS/DCS, th e approach was used to track absolute \nCBF during a hypercapnia challenge.  \nIntroduction:  The ability to m onitor cerebral blood flow  (CBF)  at the bedside is central to managing  critical -care \npatients with neurological emergencies . NIRS and DCS are ideal for bedside neuromonitoring since they are \nnoninvasive, portable and inexpensive.1,2 DCS can monitor changes in CBF3; however, patient care would benefit \nfrom measur ing absolute CBF in order to capture perfusion trends that  manifest  over days . This study presents  a \nnoninvasive method  of measuring CBF by time -resolved NIRS (trNIRS)4 using hypoxia to cause a transient decrease \nin arterial oxygen saturation  (SaO 2). This decrease acts as a blood flow tracer analogous to  an exogenous contrast \nagent.5 For validation, CBF was also measured by magnetic resonance imaging using  arterial spin labe lling (ASL) . \nMethods: Each experiment included 60  s of hypoxia induced by a computer -controlled gas delivery circuit \n(RespirAct , Thornhill Research Inc, Toronto) . SaO 2 data from  the RespirAct  were  converted to arterial \nhemoglobin change (Ca), and changes in cerebral hemoglobin concentration ( Cb) were obtained by trNIRS using the \nmean time of flight and the appropriate  sensitivity factor. CBF was determine d by indicator dilution theory  using \n𝐶𝑏(𝑡)=𝐶𝐵𝐹∙𝑅(𝑡)∗𝐶𝑎(𝑡), where * is the convolution operator  and 𝐶𝐵𝐹∙𝑅(𝑡=0)=𝐶𝐵𝐹 by definition. \nExperiments also included  acquir ing ASL and D CS data simultaneously during 5  min of hypercapnia. Measurements \nwere acquired in a 3T Siemens Biograph scanner using a single -delay pseudo -continuous ASL sequence  (post-labeling \ndelay  = 1.7 s, labelling duration  = 1.5 s).6 \nResults: Data were acquired from 9 healthy \nadults . Figure ( a) shows Cb data during hypoxia \nand the best -fit of 𝐶𝐵𝐹∙𝑅(𝑡)∗𝐶𝑎(𝑡). Figure \n(b) presents a regression plot comparing CBF \nvalues from trNIRS  and ASL  across subjects . \nFigure (c) show s CBF time series from ASL \nand calibrated DCS during hypercapnia . \nConclusion:  This study presents  a non-\ninvasive method of tracking CBF by  hybrid trNIRS/DCS . The brevity of hypoxia prevented any physiological \nresponse , and the CBF measurements estimated from trNIRS were in  good agreement  with ASL.

    "Reliabilityof brain metricsderivedfrom a Time-Domain\nFunctionalNear-Infrared Spectroscopy System\nJulienDubois1,RyanM.Field1,SamiJawhar1,ErinM.Koch1, ZahraM.Aghajan1,\nNaomiMiller1,KatherineL.Perdue*1,MoriahTaylor1\n1Kernel, 10361 Jefferson Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232\n*Presenting Author email address: Katherine.Perdue@kernel.com\nAbstract: We investigate the test-retest reliability (TRR) of a set of metrics derived from\nTime-Domain functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) recordings. We adopted a\nrepeated-measures design with 49 healthy participants, and quantified TRR over multiple time\npoints, different headsets, and multiple tasks. High reliability was found in metrics including\nhemoglobin concentrations, head tissue light attenuation, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations,\nand functional connectivity. High reliability of TD-fNIRS metrics support its potential for\ndeveloping brain-based biomarkers for neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders.\nIntroduction: Validation of novel brain imaging and recording devices is essential to assessing their accuracy,\nperformance, and potential to contribute to neuroscientific research. The objective of this study is to quantify the\nreliability and performance of Kernel’s Flow2 TD-fNIRS system with healthy participants.\nMethods: The study was a repeated measures design with the objective of comparing brain activation patterns to the\nsame tasks on two separate days and with two separate devices. Participants (N=49, 18 females, age: 43.9 ± 14.6\nyears) completed two study visits, each as following: (1) resting state session immediately followed by a passive\nauditory task; (2) the headset was removed for a short break; (3) resting state session and a go/no-go task. Neural\nrecordings were done during stages (1) and (3) either using the same Flow2 device, or a different device. Data\nunderwent standard preprocessing steps in order to obtain changes in the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (HbO)\nand deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), along with absolute chromophore concentrations ( 1–3). The passive auditory task\nconsisted of interleaved story blocks and noise blocks. Brain activation patterns were quantified with a Generalized\nLinear Model (GLM) ( 2). During resting state sessions the participants watched a 7-minute abstract movie. Resting\nneural features including absolute HbO/HbR, effective attenuation coefficient (EAC ( 4)), fractional amplitude of low\nfrequency fluctuations (fALFF), and functional connectivity (FC) were computed ( 1).\nResults: Participant-level features demonstrated moderate to strong correlations both within and across visits (Fig.\n1a).We also found that the expected regions were activated during the story condition of the passive auditory task, as\nthe foci of activations were in the lateral temporal (auditory) regions in the group-level GLMs for both visit 1 and\nvisit 2 (Fig. 1b). Participant-level correlations of the magnitude of auditory activations across visits were strong\n(Left Temporal: ⍴=0.56, p<.001; Right Temporal: ⍴=0.61, p<.001).\nFig. 1. a) Resting state metric within- and across-visit reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient) between different visits/sessions. Colored\nbackground segments correspond to commonly-used thresholds for the strength of correlation. b) Group-level GLMs for the story condition\nduring Visit 1 (left) and Visit 2 (right). Only channels (lines) that were significantly different from zero (p<0.01; uncorrected) are shown.\nConclusion: We report reliable measurements across several neural metrics extracted from both sensory task and\nresting state Flow2 recordings. The reliability demonstrated by Kernel Flow2 over time and with different devices\ncan fill a need for scalable multi-device and multi-site neuroimaging for scientific and medical use.\nReferences:1.

This study demonstrates minimal impact on \nthese instruments ’ performance when a high SNR (high QE and time dynamic range) detector is \nused.  \n \nIntroduction:  Time domain  (TD)  methods such as TD near-infrared spectroscopy (TD -NIRS), diffuse correlation \nspectroscopy (TD -DCS), and speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (TD -SCOS) are capable of pathlength  resolved \nmeasurements  unlike  continuous -wave techniques.  In the fastMOT project, a system capable of simultaneous TD - \nNIRS , TD-DCS,  and TD-SCOS measurements using an array of superconducting nanowire detectors  (SNSPD) will \nbe developed.  To determine the performance of the detector in the three modalities, a simulation pipeline based on \nMonte -Carlo (MC) simulation  [1] has been developed.  \n \nMethods: MC simulations were r un using an MRI-based head  model, consisting of five layers: skin, skull, cerebral \nspinal fluid, white and grey matter.  The outputs include the pathlength and momentum transfer inside each tissue type \nfor each detected photon.  Light sources of 785 and 1064 nm and a source -detector separation  of 30 mm were simulated \nfor an SNSPD detector.  The detector was simulated to have an instrument response function (IRF) of 40 ps  full width \nat half maximum , quantum efficiency (QE) of 74%, and dark count rate (DCR) of 5 cps.  TD-NIRS’s performance was \nevaluated by the detected number of photons (N) and the mean pathlength of photons (MPL) travelling through white \nmatter per time gate relative to measurements made with an ideal detector (i.e. IRF=0ps , QE = 100%, and DCR = 0 \ncps) for four time gates ([0 -1 ns], [1 -2 ns], [2 -3 ns], [3 -4ns]). TD -DCS data, i.e. the electric field autocorrelation \nfunction (g 1), was simulated using the method of momentum transfer as in [ 2].  From this, TD-SCOS data, i.e. s peckle \ncontrast (!2) including system parameters , were  simulated using a modified version of the method reported in [3] \nconsidering three time gates (no gating, [1 -2 ns], [2 -3 ns]) . Parameters including accuracy and precision as functions \nof system -related parameters were also studied.  \n \nResults: For TD-NIRS, Fig. 1(a) shows that MPL increases in later time gates.  The changes  of N and MPL are minor \ncompared to the ideal scenario, but uncertaint y increase s in later time gates. The simulated ideal time -gated values of \ng1 and !2 (785 nm) are shown in Fig. 1(c) . !2 was also found to be able to be measured with good accuracy and \nprecision in the considered time -gates (not shown).  \n(a) (b) (c)  \nFig 1: a) MPL  white matter. b) TD -NIRS’s MPL relative change (!\"#0\t%&'\t!\"#!\t: MPL before and after adding sensor parameters.) c) TD -\nDCS simulation of g1 and TD -SCOS simulation of (2 \n \nConclusion:  A simulation pipeline has been developed and used for simulating data as measured by  a state -of-the art \nsystem capable of simultaneous TD -NIRS, TD -DCS, and TD-SCOS.

    "Adapting  Virtual Reality Horror Experiences  using fNIRS  \n \nCallum Berger , Paul Tennent , Jocelyn Spence , Horia A. Maior, Richard Ramchurn , Max \nL. Wilson, Aleksandra Landowska  \n \nSchool of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK \nPresenting Author email address:  Callum.berger@nottingham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  This paper presents a novel VR horror experience that adapts in real -time using fNIRS \ndata. Our prior work has already established how people’s experiences of fear in VR horror \nexperiences are reflected in fNIRS data. In our system, activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal \ncortex is streamed into unity , where the data is processed using GLM before being applied to adapt \nthe visuals and audio elements of our VR experience. This aims to induce or reduce the  fear response \nof the viewer  based on the measured fear levels . The experience will tour during summer 2024.  \n \nIntroduction:  This research aims to provide an understanding of how adaptation can be done within VR horror \nexperiences using real -time fNIRS data. Our prior work  found that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had an \nincreased haemodynamic response to fear stimuli in comparison to calm stimuli . Subsequently, we have built a  horror \nexperience which  contains key moments aimed at inducing  fear. Using  adaptation, we hope to provide an experience \nthat will heighten the fear induced within these key moments in response to the brain activity measured from the \nviewer , such that it can  be made more  or less  fearful to be more enjoyable for the viewer, as desired . \n \nThe VR Horror Experience:  To gather fNIRS data,  we are using  an Artinis Octamon brain scanner1; we have \nestablished that this device can fit together comfortably with the Oculus Quest 2 headset . This data is then passed \nthrough  a Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)  into Unity . The fNIRS data is then  filtered before being  processed using GLM. \nOnce processed, the data corresponding to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is evaluated for the haemodynamic \nresponse where changes in activity will alter the subsequent fearful elements to be more personalized to the viewers \nown fears .  The experience will be initially tested in a  controlled pilot study during May 2024 to establish the efficacy \nof the experience . This will focus  on testing the adaptive experience in a lab environment  to understand how the \nexperience might be improved  or altered  before release .  \n \nResearch Methods: As with our brain controlled \nmovie2, our work involves  practice -led research  in the \nwild3. The quality of the experience, including the \nsuccess of utili sing fNIRS data to enhance it, will be \nestablished through public exhibition. We will take the \nexperience to a variety of festivals throughout the \nsummer of 2024. As well as logged event data about the \nexperience , the research will  include participant  \ninterviews to  understand their thoughts on the use of \nadaptation, how effective it is, and whether it assists in \nfurthering the design and creation of experiences.  \n \nConclusion:  As well as sharing the early results of our \npractice -led research in the wild at the fNIRS2024 \nconference,  the system can be demonstrated at the \nconference for people to discuss and experience.  \n \nReferences:  \n1.

    "Enhancing Within -Subject Consistency of fNIRS Metrics: \nRegression of Physiological Contamination Using Short -\nChannels and Auxiliary Signals  \nAteyeh Soroush1, Joel S. Burma2, Jeff F. Dunn3 \n1 Department of Neuroscience, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N  \n2 Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N  \n3 Department of Radiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N  \nateyeh.soroush@ucalgary.ca  \nAbstract: Short -separation (SS) channels are commonly used to remove physiological interference \nfrom fNIRS data, but their use in single -trial tasks and less common metrics like functional \ncoherence (FC) is limited. Our study involved healthy controls attending thre e visits a week apart, \nwhere physiological  vital signs and fNIRS responses during rest and non -rest tasks  were quantified . \nWe developed a SS -channel regression algorithm to include vital sign effects in the regression model \nand assessed within -subject cons istency before and after regression on post -processed data (e.g., \nFC). This approach aims to enhance fNIRS data consistency, and potentially improve  fNIRS -based \nclassification models and research outcomes.  \nIntroduction:  The field of fNIRS research is increasingly focused on removing unwanted physiological \ncontamination  1. While short-separation (SS) channels are considered the gold standard, their application in protocols \ninvolving single -trial tasks remains limited. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on improving the accuracy of \nregression models. This study aims to enhance the performance of SS -channel regression model by incorporating \nauxiliary physiological signals. The goal is to improve within -subject consistency in different  fNIRS metrics such as \nhemodynamic response function (HRF) and functional coherence (FC)  2. \nMethods:  We enrolled 10 healthy controls (mean age 26 ± 4, 5 female s, 5 male s) for three weekly visits. During each \nvisit, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and respiratory pattern  were measured  using LABCHART  (ADInstruments, \nColorado Springs, CO, US) . We also collected fNIRS data (NIRScout, NIRx, California , US), sampling at 3.90 Hz \nduring 8 -minute resting, 4 -minute right -hand finger -tapping, and 3 -minute continuous 2-Back tasks . Preprocessing \nincluded converting raw intensity  to differential concentration data [ΔC (ȝMol) ], signal quality check using Polonini  \n3 method with standard thresholds, motion correction with hmrwaveltemotion  4, and band -pass filtering (0.01 -1.90 \nHz). We used wavelet coherence to compute frequency -dependent correlations between each SS channel and \nphysiological signals (PB, HR, respiration ). These values were later used as regression coefficient in the final model. \nHRF and FC were computed pre - and post -regression, with intraclass correlation (ICC) and Bland -Altman plots \ncomputing the within -subject reproducibility . \nResults: Data  in this study  are being analyzed . We hypothesize that we will observe stronger correlations between the \nSS-channel data and BP within the frequency range of 0.8 -1.2 Hz. Additionally, we expect to observe higher \ncorrelation values between HR and SS -channel data within the range of 1 -1.5 Hz. The frequency range showing a \nstrong correlation between respiration and SS -channel data is expected to vary among individuals. However, there is \na possibility of high correlation values around 0.2 Hz, likely due to the influence of sinus arrhythmia.  Furthermore, \nwe expect that regressing S S-channel data based on these subject - and frequency -dependent regression coefficients \nwill lead to greater within -subject ICC values in HRF and FC values.  \nConclusion:  In conclusion,  we will show how this new algorithm performs with regards to  improving the \nconsistency of fNIRS outputs, such as HRF and FC. Our goal is to contribute to  refining the fNIRS processing \npipeline , particularly for use in disease classification or monitoring.  \nReferences  \n1.  Zhou X, Sobczak G, McKay CM, Litovsky RY .

However, this method introduces biases in data \ninterpretati on. The aim of our study is to evaluate the potential of fNIRS to assess auditory -related \nhemoglobin changes as well as cross -modal plasticity in early -blind subjects while ensuring a more \nnatural experimental framework.  12 early -blind and 16 sighted adult s listened to short noise -bursts \npresented from speakers during one fNIRS session. Results showed cerebral differences between \nboth groups as well as between cerebral regions involved in cross -modal plasticity. Thus, fNIRS \nallows the visualisation of audit ory-related cerebral activity and contributes to our understanding of \ncross -modal plasticity in early -blind populations.  \n \nIntroduction: Previous functional neuro imaging studies showed  cross -modal plasticity in blind subjects.  However , \ndue to methodological restrict ions, auditory stimuli were usually presented through earphones and required very \nspecific presentation parameters to mimic sounds coming from different spatial locations. This method  may introduce \nbiases in data interpretation as the intensity and location of activated brain regions depend  on the stimuli’s space \nlocation. Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a brain imaging technique that measures changes in both \nhemoglobin concentrations in a more natur al experimental framework. Hence, in the current study, we aimed to \nevaluate the potential of fNIRS to assess hemoglobin changes evoked by an auditory stimulati on as well as  cross -\nmodal plasticity  in early -blind subjects .  \nMethods:  12 early -blind adults  (mean age = 45 years old) and 16 sighted controls (mean age = 27 years old) were \nrecruited. Participants were seated in a darkened  anechoic room and submitted to short noise -bursts (30 and 50 ms \nduration). Sounds were presented randomly from one of the four speakers positioned at equal distance from the \nparticipant and placed in quadrants  (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right). Ten blocks of data were recorded \nwith a multi -channel frequency -domain NIRS Imagent Tissue Oximeter (16 detectors and 47 sources with two \nwavelengths of 690 nm and 830 nm). Each block contained four nois e bursts trials and five resting session s of 30 sec \nduration. Changes in hemoglobin concentrations were recorded in the temporal, parietal and occipital cortices \nbilaterally. Data were analyzed u sing two complementary methods : 1) block averaging and 2) general linear model \n(GLM).  \nResults: Block-averaging results showed that both groups activated the temporal lobes bilaterally . Changes in oxy -\nhemoglobin concentrations  in the left and right visual areas decreased at the onset of stimulation. When comparing \nboth groups, results showed that  responses in oxy -, deoxy - and total hemoglobin were significantly different between \nearly -blind and sighted subjects in the occipita l regions . GLM analys is showed, on one hand, brain activations in the \nposterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus in early -blind participants  and d eactivat ions in the right superior \nparietal lobule, and the left inferior and middl e occipital gyri. On the other hand, in sighted participants, activated \nregions were located in the posterior regions of the temporal cortices with more regions activated in the left than in \nthe right hemisphere. In addition, bilateral temporal and parietal oxy -hemoglobin t -values were higher in sighted \ncompared to early -blind subjects. In summary, results  showed temporal and spatial differences between sighted and \nearly -blind subjects as well as between cerebral regions involved in cross -modal plastic ity.  \nConclusion:  Our study is the first to examine cerebral plasticity in early -blind subjects using fNIRS. Overall, our \nfindings demonstrate the strong potential of fNIRS to assess hemoglobin changes evoked by an auditory stimulation, \nhence contributing to our understanding of cross -modal plasticity in early -blind populations. Based on our results, we \nconfirm a right temporal preference paired with auditory processing in early -blind participants.  \n138 of 398",

Three distinct algorithms i.e., Gaussian \nNaïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were used for classification. For mental arithmetic \nactivity, the sitting posture emerged as the most effective one with maximum accuracy of 84.2%. \nConversely, for the picture recall activity, the upper- body  movement emerged as the most effective \none with maximum accuracy of 87.4%. \n \nIntroduction: Body posture interacts with various physiological and neural processes, affecting blood flow, neural \nactivation, hormonal regulation, and emotional states [1]. The aim of this study is to explore fNIRS as a non-invasive \nmethod for identifying the most effective body posture for two different cognitive activities. \n \nMethod: Ten healthy participants (5 male, 5 females; median age 25 ± 5) underwent fNIRS data acquisition using an \n8×8 sens or array on the prefrontal cortex region. They performed mental arithmetic and picture recall tasks, each with \n30s rest, followed by activity. Mental arithmetic included 10 arithmetic problems (4s each) with verbal responses. \nArithmetic problems included addition or subtraction of two-digit numbers from two-digit numbers e.g., 25+17. \nPicture recall activity showed 10 images (2s each) to the participants followed by verbal recall (15s) after 30s rest. \nEach task had 3 trials (10 problems/ 10 images per trial), totaling 225s for arithmetic and 315s for picture recall \nactivity. Tasks were repeated for sitting, standing, and upper- body  movement separately for each of the activity. \n \nResults: Five different statistical features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and peak) were extracted from the \nfNIRS signals using MATLAB. Five- feature combination was used for the classification. For mental arithmetic \nactivity, the sitting posture emerged as most effective one. Random Forest yields maximum accuracy of 84.2%. For \npicture recall activity, the upper-body movement emerged as most effective one. Random Forest yields maximum \naccuracy of 87.4% as shown in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 1: Classification Accuracies of cognitive activities for different postures using Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest \n \nConclusion: For mental arithmetic activity, sitting posture emerged as the most effective one.

Commercial near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices provide continuous monitoring  of tissue \noxygen saturation (StO 2) but establishing a critical StO 2 threshold level has proven challenging . Our team has \ndeveloped a non -invasive light -based system incorporating trNIRS  and DCS  to monitor CBF and CMRO 2 [1] during  \nsurgical procedures . Time-resolved  NIRS  reduces  extracerebral signal  contamination [2], leading to a more accurate \nassessment of cerebral StO 2 [3]. The CMRO 2 can be measured by combining  StO 2 with CBF measurements from \nDCS, which  provid es a means of assessing if oxygen delivery to the brain matches energy demands  [4]. \nThe goals of this study  were to  adapt the  hybrid system to operate under  the conditions of the operation room (OR) \nand to demonstrate its ability to  detect anesthesia -induced reductions in CBF and CMRO 2. \nMethods:  To accommodate the OR conditions, the system was well-shielded to prevent the detrimental effects of \nambient light. Additionally, the probe was specifically designed to be compact and adaptable to surgical procedures . \nTo date, measurements  have been conducted on  five patients  undergoing elective shoulder surgery  with the probe  \nplaced on the forehead . DCS  and tr NIRS  data were acquired  simultaneously during anesthesia induction  and post-\nprocessed to calculate CBF , StO 2, and CMRO 2. \nResults: Averaged across five patients, anesthesia  caused substantial reduction s in CBF  (43%±13%) and CMRO 2 \n(48%±16%), with only a 3.5%±2% increase in StO 2. CMRO 2 time series from a representative patient is shown \nin Fig. 1. The s pikes evident in  the graph are motion artifacts  in the DCS \ndata due to head motion during anesthesia induction . \nDiscussion  and conclusion : This p reliminary study demonstrated the \nability of our hybrid system to detect CBF and CMRO 2 reductions during \nsurgery. Simultaneous  decreases reflect the tight coupling of blood flow \nto metabolism in the brain. The next step is to monitor these parameters  \nin a larger patient cohort to assess the  hemodynamic and metabolic \nstability  particularly  during transient periods of hypotensi ve, which are a \ncommon occurrence during shoulder surgery as patients are in a semi -\nupright position.  \nThis project is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and \nthe National Science and Engineering Research Council . \n[1] Milej, D., et al., Biomedical Optics Express 11(8), 4571 –4585 (2020).  \n[2] Liebert, A., et al.

    "Insights into auditory development assessment: fNIRS \nprotocol proposal \n \nLurdiana Guimarães Dias1, Débora Marques de Miranda2*, Suelen Rosa de Oliveira3, Rebecca Chrispim \nSilva1, Ana Kelly Barbosa Vieira1, Luciana Macedo de Resende1 \n1 Speech- Language and Hearing Sciences Post Graduation Program, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil \n2 Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil  \n3 Molecular Medicine Technology Center (CTMM),  School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil  \n* Presenting author email: debora.m.miranda@gmail.com  \n \nUniversidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av. Alfredo Balena 190, sala 114, Minas Gerais, Brazil.   \n \n \nAbstract:  This study details the structuring of an fNIRS protocol designed to assess auditory \ndevelopment in normal-hearing children, as well as in those with hearing loss and/or cochlear \nimplant candidates, aged between 0 to 4 years old. This protocol, assembled after acquiring \nparameters from the literature, consists of three presentations of 20 seconds each, containing thre e \ndifferent stimuli: pure tone, International Speech Test Signal, and storytelling. All presentations \nwere intervaled with randomized duration of silence blocks. Once this protocol is tested and \nconsistent responses are obtained in normal-hearing children, it may be applied to those in auditory \nrehabilitation. \nIntroduction:  The first years of life are crucial for both structural and functional hearing brain development. Despite \nits significance, the auditory cortex development in this period remains poorly understood, partly due to challenges in \nobtaining neuroimages in infants. Nonetheless, Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) enabl es brain function \nassessment in awake infants, allow insights into auditory cortex development. There is, however, a lack of a \nstandardized approach for acquisition parameters among studies, which suggests that an assessment protocol may be \nuseful for carrying out th is research. For this reason, this study aims to propose a fNIRS protocol that can facilitate \nstudies involving human auditory development at a cortical level through this tool.  \nMethods: A concise review of the literature was undertaken to serve as a foundation for discussing the acquisition \nparameters in other studies and our research group's previous experience. The acquisition parameters considered were \nage, stimuli type and intensity, presentation source and mode, and number of optodes and channels. For the data pre-\nprocessing stage, manual identification and removal of spikes were reported, both followed by the substitution of \ncontaminated data with linear interpolation. The principal component analysis was used to filter out motion artifacts. \nAlong with that, a bandpass filter was applied to remove high-frequency noise. Subsequently, intensity data was \nconverted into optical density changes, and then into relative concentration changes of HbO and HbR. The statistical \nanalysis primarily focused on identifying the activated channels, determining the region of interest (ROI), calculating \nthe effect size of HbO variation, and comparing the cortical response based on different conditions, groups, channels, \nand ROI. \nResults: The proposed protocol was designed for children aged between 0 to 4 years old. As for stimuli, we suggest \nthree distinct auditory triggers: pure tone, International Speech Test Signal, and storytelling. All recorded stimuli \nshould be presented through a speaker at 60 dB NA, at approximately 50 cm. A minimum of three presentations for \n20 seconds of each stimulus should be applied, interleaved with randomized duration of silence blocks, to establish \nthe recording baseline. Children should sit on their parents’ lap or a chair during data acquis ition.  \nConclusion:  A well -defined acquisition protocol with replicable responses is relevant for comprehending cortical \nactivity upon auditory stimulation within normal-hearing children's development \nand understanding this process in hearing-impaired and deaf children after \nhearing rehabilitation with amplification and/or implanted devices. Once this \nprotocol is tested and consistent responses are obtained in normal-hearing \nchildren, it may be applied to those with hearing loss throughout the \nrehabilitation process. \n141 of 398",
    "Explainable classification of fNIRS data using approximate \nreasoning \n \nMohammadreza Jamalifard1, Javier Fumanal-Idocin1, Benjamin Jones2, Javier Andreu-\nPérez1 \n1 School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex \n2 School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences, University of Essex \njm23525@essex.ac.uk \n \nAbstract:  Use of an explainable classification model implementing a fuzzy rules approach to \nidentify between non-concussed and individuals with a history of concussion. The model was \ntrained using women's (n=16) rugby union data; height (cm):165, weight (kg):76, age (yrs):32.6 \n±14.7. Subjects completed a visual search task and squat stand maneuver. ∆O 2Hb and ∆HHb average \npeak amplitude and area under the curve were utilized as well as demographic features. The \nclassification model produced 83.33% accuracy while explaining each output, demonstrating the \nsignificance of; player age and the average peak amplitude of ∆HHb signals during both visual \nsearch and squat to stand task.  \n \nIntroduction:  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) is instrumental in deploying AI real world health systems \nbecause they are more reliable and can interact easier with human actors. Rule based classifiers are one of the most \nused for this kind of applications, as they can be easily understood, and their patterns can also give additional insights \nof the problem.  \n \nMethods: Data was collected using a 24-channel system (Brite, Artinis Medical Systems, Elst, The Netherlands).  To \nbuild the fuzzy rule-based classifier, a series of fuzzy sets using the quantiles of each feature distribution were \nconstructed. Rules are constructed using a genetic algorithm that maximizes a classification metric. Each pattern found \nis validated by the support (frequency) and confidence (correlation between antecedent and consequent) measures. \nOversampling of the minority class was used in the training phase. \n \nResults: As a result of our method, we obtained a rule base that contained 4 rules for non-concussed players and 2 \nrules for concussed ones. Besides accuracy, we also computed the dominance score, which represents the product of \nthe support and confidence of each rule, which we use as a quality metric for each rule. The overall accuracy of the \nmethod was 83.33%.  The rules obtained are displayed in the table below. \n \n \nClass Rule  Dominance Score \nNon-concussed IF ss_mean_peak_dxy IS Medium 0.62 IF ww_mean_peak_dxy IS High 0.65 IF ss_auc_oxy IS High 0.72 IF Age IS Medium 0.67 Concussed IF ww_mean_peak_dxy IS Medium 0.21 \nIF ww_auc_oxy IS Medium 0.39 \n*ss- squat stand; ww – where’s wally (visual search task) \nConclusion:  In this work, we have shown how to extract rules from data and how to use them to relate features from \nfNIRS data to a non-concussed/concussed classification problem. We exclusively found single-valued patterns, which \nis probably due to the small size of the data. For our future research, we intend to test the same classifier on larger \nnumbers of samples and validate the rules found with professional practitioners. \nDr Javier Fumanal-Idocin's research is supported by the European Union under a Marie Sklodowska-Curie action for \nthe YUFE4postdoc programme. \n1.

Abdominal near -infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRS) holds promise for the early diagnosis of intestinal ischemia associated with \nNEC,  but the optimal NIRS sensor design for intestinal oximetry is not well defined.  Using finite \nelement modeling to simulate abdominal NIRS signals from infants, we  computed contrast -to-noise \nratio (CNR) as a function of  source -detector distance for intestinal oximetry.  Intestine CNR was \nmaximal at source -detector distances between 4 -5 cm. Sensitivity to intestine tissue also exceeded \nsensitivity to superficial adipose tissue in the 4 -5 cm range.  \n \nIntroduction:  Necrotizin g enterocolitis (NEC), marked by localized or widespread injury of intestinal tissue, is a \nmajor cause of morbidity and mortality for preterm infants and for infants with congenital heart defects . Unfortunately, \ncurrent diagnosis of NEC often occurs at irr eversibly late stages in NEC pathogenesis.1 Abdominal near -infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRS) holds promise for early prediction of NEC based on the hypothesis that NEC is linked with \nreduced abdominal perfusion to the intestine. Preliminary research suggests th at abdominal NIRS can detect intestinal \nischemia via its measurement of blood oxygen saturation in the microvasculature perfusing the intestine,2,3 but artifacts \nfrom hemodynamics in superficial tissue layers hinder reliability. Herein, we simulated abdomi nal NIRS signals to \nidentify NIRS source -detector distances (SDD) that are optimally sensitive to infant intestinal vasculature.     \n \nMethods: A 3-D model of the abdomen was constructed from a CT scan of a neonate’s abdominal tract. NIRS fluence \nrate signals (750 nm wavelength) were simulated for source -detector distances between 1 -10 cm across different light \nabsorptions in epidermis, adipose, and intestine tissues. For vertically and horizontally oriented sensor positions near \nthe umbilicus, the sens itivity of NIRS to intestine and adipose tissues was determined  (sensitivity defined as the \nmeasured tissue absorption change with NIRS divided by the true absorption change; homogeneous tissue model used \nfor measurement) . Fluence rates without noise were derived from the finite element solution of the photon diffusion \nequation for the 3 -D abdomen model. Noise from in vivo data was added to compute contrast -to-noise ratio ( CNR ).4 \n \nResults: Sensitivity \nto intestine tissue \nexceeded sensitivity \nto superficial adipose \ntissue in the 4 -5 cm \nrange.  CNR was \nmaximal at  SDDs  \nbetween 4 -5 cm, and \ncomparable between \nsensor positions.  \n \nConclusion:  NIRS  \nSDDs of 4 -5 cm are \noptimal  for probing  intestinal oxygenation changes in infants . The 3 -D model of the abdomen used herein c an also be \nused for testing of future  NIRS  analysis algorithms to separate the intestinal signal from superficial tissue artifacts.  \n1.

    "Is there extracerebrovascular CO2 reactivity ?  \nA SPA-fNIRS study  \n \nSabino Guglielmini1,2, Elena Wiggli1, Martin Wolf1 and Felix Scholkmann1,3 \n \n1 Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland ; \n2 Family Larsson -Rosenquist Foundation Center for Neurodevelopment, Growth and Nutrition of the Newborn, Department of Neonatology, \nUniversity Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland;  \n3 Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland  \nPresenting a uthor email address: Martin.Wolf @usz.ch  \n \nAbstract:  We investigated the effect of changes in systemic physiology induced by respiratory task s \non cerebral and extracerebral tissue hemodynamics and oxygenation. We found that both tissue \ncompartment s are affected  by these tasks, indicating the existence of an extracere brovascular CO 2 \nreactivity and the  need to take this into account when performin g and interpreting fNIRS studies.  \n \nIntroduction:  The signals measured by  fNIRS comprise component s induced by neuro -vascular coupling and those \nnot induced by it. Changes in hemodynamic and oxygenation in the extracerebral tissue layer are primarily induced \nby changes in systemic physiology. The extent to which  changes in arterial CO 2 affect this  tissue compartment \n(extracerebrovascular CO 2 reactivity) is currently not fully  understood.  The aim was to determine this.  \n \nMethods: We used systemic physiology augmented functional near -infrared spectroscopy (SPA -fNIRS) to investigate  \nin healthy adults (age: 32.5 ± 14.9 years, 9 males, 11 females) how changes in arterial CO 2 induced by changes in \nbreathing  (two tasks: breath -holding and hyperventilation)  affect changes in tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics in \nthe cerebral as well as the extracerebral tissue layer above  the frontal cortex.  \n \nResults: We found that both the cerebral and the extracerebral tiss ue layer show  characteristic changes in \nhemodynamics and oxygenation induced by the breathing  tasks  (Figure) . \n \nConclusion:  Our study shows that there is not only a cerebral reactivity but also an extracerebrovascular  reactivity. \nThe reactivity is possibly triggered by changes in the concentration of arterial CO 2 (extracerebrovascular CO 2 \nreactivity) , but the role of the autonomic nervous system activity cannot be  excluded.  Our findings highlight that the \nextracerebral  tissue layer (normally probed by short -channels, i.e. light channels with small short -detector separations)  \nis influenced by changes in systemic physiology induced by a respiratory challenge, most probably mediated by \narterial CO 2 and the autonomic nervou s system.  \n \n \n \nFigure: Changes in fNIRS signals during breath -holding and hyperventilation  (shaded area = standard error) .

To address this, four participants completed at least ten \nsessions of a right -hand finger tapping task while brain activity was measured with 102 fNIRS \nchannels. Reproducibility was quantified as the probability of significant task related activity across \nsessions at the channel and source levels. Individual reproducibility ranged [0.4, 1.0] across \nparticipants, spatial s cale, and hemoglobin species and significantly more repeatability for \noxyhemoglobin (F(1,18) = 7.81, p<0.05 ) and ROI based analysis (F(2,18) = 4.48, p<0.05 ). \nIncreasing reproducibility can further improve fNIRS utility in clinical settings.  \nIntroduction:  Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is becoming a popular approach for  noninvasively \nmeasuring  brain activity via changes in oxy - (HbO) and deoxy hemoglobin  (HbR) concentration. Several aspects of \nfNIRS imaging are appealing for clinical applications yet the reproducibility of fNIRS over time  remains unclear . This \nstudy aims to identify  an analysis pipeline which increases the reproducibility of fNIRS at the level of individual \nparticipants with an eye towards future clinical applications.  \nMethods:  Four participants (age: 25 -30 years, 4 female) completed a Right -Hand finger tapping task (10 blocks of 20 \nsecond tapping followed by  20 second rest)  over at least 10 sessions while fNIRS was acquired from an array of 32 \nemitters and 32 detectors (102 channels, sampled at 3.125Hz) over the entire scalp.  Following motion correction and \nscalp blood flow removal , a General Linear Model [1] was implemented to identify task -related brain activity  across \nsessions . Significant task related activit y was source localized via minimum norm estimation  using digitized optode \npositions for each session  and patient specific brain MRI . Significant source activity was determined  via a two -sample \nt-test between source localized activity and a null distribution . Both a vertex -based  and a region of interest (ROI)  \nbased analys is encompassing 200 functionally defined ROIs [2], were investigated . Regions with significant activity \nrequire  at least 10% of vertices within the ROI to be significant for a given session. Reproducibility at the channel and \nsource  levels for HbO and HbR was characterized using a  Predictive Value Analysis (PVA) to quantify the  probability \nof significant task related activity occurring across sessions. A two -way repeated measures ANOVA was performed \non the max PV A over the somatosensory and motor cortices for each participant  to identify which chromophore and \nspatial scale can be reliably used in fNIRS research.  \nResults: Individual differences in reproducibility were present as some \nparticipants showed more widespread activity while others were more focal  \nregardless of analysis pipeline . Figure 1 shows the max PV A for each \nhemoglobin species (HbO: red; HbR: blue) and spatial scale (Channel: light; \nROI: medium; Vertex: dark ). Thick horizontal bars represent group median \nPV A.  The ROI and Vertex  HbO analyses were  most reproducible  (median \nPV A = 0.96) . Following the two-way ANOV A,  HbO and ROI -based analysis \nwas significantly more reproducible than HbR (F(1,1 8) = 7.81, p<0.05 ) and \nchannel -based (F(2,18) = 4.48, p<0.05 ), but not vertex -based,  respectfully.   \nConclusion:  This study showed the HbO -ROI pipeline  to be significantly \nmore reproducible at the individual participant level th an alternative analys es. With further improvements in \npreprocessing, it may be  possible to see increased reproducibility for the other tested pipelines . This would be \nbeneficial for future clinical applications  (i.e., identifying epileptic zones)  which require increased spatial resolution.  \nAcknowledgements:  This work is supported by the Bleser Family Foundation Neurology Research Fund (to HW) \nand the Office of Naval Research (Grant #: N00014 -19-1-2560 to HW).

    "Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Based Cerebral Oximetry  \nMonitoring in Extremely Preterm Infants : \nDiscussion of Two Recent Controversial Clinical Trials   \n(SafeBoosC -II, SafeBoosC -III) \n \n \nMartin Wolf1, Marco Ferrari2, Felix Scholkmann1,3 \n \n1Department  of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland  \n2Department of Life, Health and Environmental Science, University of L’Aquila, L’Aquila, Italy  \n3Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University  of Bern , Bern, Switzerland  \nmartin.wolf@usz.ch  \n \nAbstract:  There were two studies on the usefulness of near -infrared spectroscopy based cerebral oximetry ( NIRS CO) \nin extremely preterm infants to prevent death or severe brain injury. The first smaller study showed a borderline \nsignificant but large effect. However, the second larger study showed no differences between the NIRS CO and control \ngroup s. Our statistical analysis showed that the results of the two studies are significantly different. Possible reasons \nfor thi s discrepancy are discussed.  \nIntroduction:  Recently, Hansen et al.1 evaluated the usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy based NIRS CO2 in \nextremely preterm infants to prevent death or severe brain injury (SafeBoosC -III, n = 1601 ). In a previous smaller \nstudy (SafeBoosC -II, n = 166 )3, there was a borderline significant advantage for NIRS CO (death: unadjusted p = 0.049, \nadjusted p = 0.10; brain injury: unadjusted p = 0.053, adjusted p = 0.11). Is this difference between the two study \nresults significant? What might  be the reason  for the difference ? \nMethods: We compared the results of the two studies by an analysis of difference of pooled relative risks.  \nResults: The incidences of death and severe brain injury were similar between the two contr ol groups in both studies1,3, \nwhile in the NIRS CO group these incidences were higher ( severe brain damage : by 94.0%, death : by 52.2%) in the \nnew SafeBoosC -III study1 compared to the previous SafeBoosC -II study3 (Fig.1). These differences are highly \nsignifi cant ( p = 0.010 ). \nDiscussion:  Why is there such a significant and tremendous discrepancy? We looked at the differences between the \ntwo studies.  One probable reason is that in the previous study all centers were experts in NIRS CO, but not in the new \nstudy , where those, who were not familiar with NIRS CO, were instructed by a  web-based training . This training was \nprobably insufficient  to enable them to understand \nNIRS CO properly and to draw conclusions from  the \nNIRS CO values.  These m ethodological differences  \ntherefore probably play an important role in explaining \nthe different study results.   \nConclusions: Although NIRS CO did not show any \nadvantage in the newer larger study, we think NIRS CO \nshould not be disregarded for neuromonitoring in \nneonatology4. We believe that more research is needed \nfor evaluating the clinical effectiveness of NIRS CO in \nneonates.  \n \nReferences :  \n1  Hansen ML, Pellicer A, Hyttel -S¡rensen S, et al.

    "Individualiz ed head models from registered optodes or \nphotogrammetry for improved DOT image reconstruction  \n \nNils Harmening1,2,*, Laura Carlton3, Alexander von Lühmann1,2,3,* \n \n1 Intelligent Biomedical Sensing (IBS) Lab, Technische Universität Berlin, 10587 Berlin, Germany  \n2 BIFOLD – Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data, 10587 Berlin, Germany  \n3 Neurophotonics Center, Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA  \nemail: nils.harmening@tu -berlin.de , vonluehmann@tu -berlin.de   \nAbstract:  We propose a  data-driven  algorithm to approximate individual head anatomies in case \nof unavailable MRI /CT scans to improve image reconstruction accuracy over widely used standard \nhead models such as Colin27. B ased on a low-dimensional representation of a large head model \ndatabase we derive individual head parameters solely  from additional knowledge of the subject’s \nscalp  as gained from e.g. photogrammetry scans or exact optode positions. Preliminary photon \nsimulation  results show significantly less deviation  from the subject’s ground truth head model \ncompared to Colin27  and raises hopes for  improv ed source reconstruction s with little effort  in \nmany future fNIRS studies . \nIntroduction:  Accurate localization  of brain activit y via Diffuse Optical Tomography  (DOT) relies on simulating  \nphoton transportation through the different biological tiss ues of the human head . Recent studies  (e.g. [1]) underlined \nthe importance of accurate anatomical head modeling  in order to achieve reliable image reconstruction results. \nHowever, this requires structural MRI or CT scans of all participants, which is often too costly and time -consuming \nand thus not part of most of today’s fNIRS and DOT research studies. Instead, anatomical models from a single \nindividual ( Colin27 ) or an average  MRI template (ICBM -152) are used, which result in inaccurate and sometimes \neven incorrect source reconstructions.  We therefore propose a head model individualization technique  in the case of \nunavailable  MRI/CT scans using individually measured scalp proxies  like exact optode positions . \nMethods:  Database construction:  A large database of head anatomies was created by segmenting MRI scans of 316 \nhealthy subjects [ 2] using an automatic segmentation pipeline [ 3] including  surface mesh  generation of the different \nbiological tissues (scalp, skull, CSF, cortex) . Subsequently , a principal component analysis (PCA) of the normalized \nvertex coordinates extracted  the main shape components . Anatomy -Approximation : Individual PC parameters are \napproximated by minimizing the shape difference (Euclidian  distance along the surface mesh normals) of the PC \nreconstructed scalp surface and the recorded scalp coordinates (from e.g. photogrammetry  or exact optode  \npositions ). Experiment : The full individualization pipeline was tested under realistic experimental conditions. A \nphotogrammetry scan of a single subject wearing an fNIRS cap with 56 optodes was acquired before conducting a  \nmotor  task. Exact optode positions were extracted using the upcoming fNIRS analysis toolbox cedalion. B ased on \nthe recorded scalp coordinates and the exact optode positions the individual anatomy was approximated.  Evaluatio n: \nThe performance  of the approximated head model was compared  to the Colin27 and the ground truth head model , \nwhich was derived from the subject ’s own MRI scan.  From photon simulations using MCX [ 4] we computed f or \nevaluation (1) the ratio of the average partial pathlength in brain (PPL B) and total pathlength (TPL) and (2) the \nsource reconstructi on accuracy of  simulated brain activity (using synthetic hemodynamic response function s (HRF )) \nplaced at various  motor  cortex areas . \nResults: Preliminar y results show improved accuracy of the individualized head model over the standard Colin27. \nIn PPL B/TPL ratio (1) the difference to the original MRI head model amount s to 57 ± 9 % (Colin: 253 ± 160%). The \nsource reconstruction (2) accuracy lies at 18.6 ± 8.2 mm (Colin: 29.4 ± 17.6 mm, original MRI: 12.9 ± 17.7 mm).  \nConclusion:  Using individualized head models based on knowledge of the subject’s scalp geometry  can \nsignificantly improve source reconstruction accuracy .

    "Impact of neurostimulation on performance enhancement in \nrobotic surgery  \n \nZiqi Zhang1, Ronak Patel1, Tia Lam2, Ara Darzi1*, Felipe Orihuela -Espina2*, Daniel R \nLeff1* \n1 Imperial College London , UK.; 2 University of Birmingham, UK.  \nPresenting Author email address: z.zhang23@imperi.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Robotic surgery  has enhanced operation flexibility and patients’ recovery  while \nextending surgeons’ training time over traditional methods  at the same time . Although tDCS \nneurostimulation improve s immediate motor behaviour, its  impact and long-term retention on \ncortical dynamics are not understood. fNIRS  data was longitudinally collected from a cohort of \nsurgeons during a robotic surgery knot -tying tasks receiving  sham vs tDCS neurostimulation . This \nstudy applies a GLM to examine differences at the fNIRS data during the pre-, post- and retention  \nsessions . This analysis  aims to reveal the mechanism underlying tDCS’s influence on robotics \nsurgical skills and motor learning.  Preliminary results sugge st tDCS leads to a significant activation \nin the right hemisphere . \nIntroduction:  Transcr anial direct  current stimulation (tDCS)  has been proven to have positive effects on motor \nbehavio urs and clinical performance in surgeons . However, how tDCS influences  cortical dynamics  to improve \nperformance  remains un known . fNIRS is a low -cost neuroimaging technology with higher robustness to motion \nartefacts which could be used to monitor cortical hemodynamic responses. GLM  allows the regression of signals \nagainst various of experiment factors and is commonly used in functional neuroimaging analysis. Difference s in HRF \nacross subjects and potential sustained stimulation  require GLM could able to reflect subtle changes . This study uses \na general linear model to analyze neural activities before and after prefrontal cortex  (PFC)  tDCS (either  “active” or \n“shame ” stimulation) while  performing robotic surgery knot -tying tasks and attempt s to discuss  whether tDCS at PFC \nhas effects on certain brain region s. \nMethods:  fNIRS data was processed in  Homer 3 whereby  median filter, channel pruning, band -pass filter, detrending, \nmotion correction and block -averaging operations were applied.  Block-averaged time series  were subsequently \nanalyzed  with the  GLM. The design matrix X contains 5 elements: a drift, a gamma HRF convoluted with event \nstimulation, a constant term, first and second -order derivative of HRF . The GLM was solved using the ordinary least \nsquare s. Further  t-test (alpha 0.05, Bonferroni -Dunn correction) and  two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA)  \nconsidering channels and stimulation type as two main factors to evaluate the 𝛽𝐻𝑅𝐹 in 6 cortical  region s of interest : \nleft, middle and right PFC, SMA , left and right primary motor cortex ( M1). \nResults: Analysis by unpaired t -test of 𝛽𝐻𝑅𝐹 difference between post -stimulation and baseline of O 2Hb signal, the \nresult indicated that for junior surgeons, both left and right PFC show greater  activation in tDCS  group compared with \nshame group ( p<.05) while right M1 demonstrates  significance de -activation ( p<.001). In two -way ANOVA analysis, \nboth right PFC and right M1 revealed a higher significance factor of stimulation type  (p<.05, p<.01) . The channel \nfactor in all regions presented no significant effect.  \n \nFig. 1 (A) fNIRS montage; (B) design matrix ; (C) example \nchannel raw HbO 2 block -averaged signal with GLM \nestimated signal.  \nConclusions : Preliminary results suggest that  active tDCS leads to greater  right hemisphere  activation compared to  \nshame  stimulation .

    "An fNIRS Processing P ipeline Based on Adaptive \nThresholding Wavelet Denoising  \nZhenchen Lin1, Mary Goble1, Felipe Orihuela -Espina2,*, Daniel R Leff1,*  \n1 Imperial College London , UK, 2 University of Birmingham , UK \nPresenting Author email ad dress: zhenchen.lin23@imperial.ac.uk  \nAbstract: In this work we  present  an fNIRS  processing pipeline  that utilizes BayesShrink  based \nadaptive thresholding in wavelet motion artifact removal. The pipeline is tested on an  fNIRS  \ndataset collected from 20 surgical trainees  [1] against other methods and  achieves significant \nperformance increase  (p<0.05)  according to  both in -group and between group  t-test.  \nIntroduction : Motion artifact (MA) could significantly distort functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data. \nOne method for its removal is wavelet based denoising, which commonly utilizes Daubechies 5  (db5) and applies \nhard thresholding to wavelet coefficients [ 2]. However, db5 wavelet is more efficient in detecting spikes than \nsteps -shaped artifacts, while hard thresholding requires manual tuning for optimal results. To address such \ndisadvantage, we propose an fNIRS processing pipeline that incorporates an MA rem oval algorithm based on \nHaar wavelet, db5, and BayesShrink  [3] adaptive thresholding.  \nMethods:  The proposed pipeline consists of the following sequential steps: conversion from light intensity to \noptical density (OD), channel pruning (minimal signal -to-noise ratio 4), lowpass filtering (subject dependent \ncutoff frequency), Haar wavelet denoising (6 levels, BayesShrink thresholding), db5 wavelet denoising (6 levels, \nBayesShrink thresholding), linear trend removal, OD to hemoglobin  concentration conversion (modified Beer -\nLamber Law), and block averaging. The pipeline is tested on a pre -collect ed fNIRS dataset [ 1], which is recorded \nusing a  NIRSports 2 device (CW wavelengths 760nm and 850nm, 45 channels) on 20 surgical trainees during five \nsuturing tasks under each three stress levels (self -paced, time -pressured, and time -pressured with cognitive \nstressor).  The original dataset  is divided into 60 segments according to subject and stress level before processing. \nSix other pipelines are formed as control group s by replacing the proposed MA algorithm with spine interpolation, \ntPCA, Haar wavelet only , db5 wavelet only, and Haar -db5 combined . Performance is measured by contrast to \nnoise ratio (CNR) of the block -averaged data . The results of proposed pipeline and control groups are t-tested for  \nthe following hypothesis: The proposed pipeline performs better than those in the control group s.  \nResults: Statistically significant (p<0.05) CNR increase can \nbe observed in more than 50% of segments according to \nFigure 1. Increase in mean CNR is also present, with p<0.01 \nin all six tests between mean CNR of proposed method and \ncontrol groups.  \nConclusion:  Both in -group and between -group result indicate \nsignificant performance increase empowered by the proposed \npipeline , thus accepting the hypothesis. Future works lies in \nincorporating heart rate data and short channels into this \npipeline to facilitate the removal of physiological signal.  \nReference : [1] Goble et al, fNIRS -UK 2023  \n[2] Huang  et al, (2022).

    "Neural Mechanisms of Intergroup Bias in Smile\nDiscrimination and Facial Mimicry: A fNIRS Study\nRuihan Wu1, Uzair Hakim2, Sara De Felice1, Natalie Gunasekara2, \nIsla Jones1, Sarah J White1, Antonia F de C Hamilton1 \n1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, Alexandra House, 17 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AZ \n2Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building, Gower Street, \nLondon WC1E 6BT \nPresenter email address: r.wu.16@ucl.ac.uk \nAbstract:   People are biased in their perception of genuine smiles from ingroup members; this study \naimed to identify the neural mechanism of this effect and test if it is linked to spontaneous mimicry \nof smiles.  Thirty -three adults viewed videos of ingroup/outgroup actors producing genuine /posed \nsmiles .  The abilit ies to differentiate  smiles (genuine -posed)  and gender (male -female) were \nassessed ; participants’ facial movements were recorded as well as whole -head f NIRS with a \nShimadzu LabNIRS system.  The  medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  \n(dlPFC)  were more activated during ingroup smiles, while the inferior frontal gyrus  (IFG)  was more \nactivated during outgroup smiles.  There were no effe cts of group on behaviour or mimicry. This \nshows that fNIRS can pick up neural mechanisms of intergroup bias in a social task . \nIntroduction:  Genuine smiles are spontaneous and associated with emotional enjoyment, while posed smiles act as \npurposeful  communication  tools  in social  situations  and can be a potential  signal  that the real emotional  state is \nobscured (Ekman, 2003).  Wu et al. (2024) found that intergroup bias can modulate smile perception: ingroup smiles \nare judged as more genuine than outgroup smiles .  However,  the mechanisms involved in intergroup processes have \nnot been fully revealed, and little is known about the brain correlates that are related to these processes.  Additionally, \nfacial mimicry has been suggested to facilitate smile discrimination (Niedenthal et al., 2010) .  Thus, the current study \naimed to investigate the neural mechanisms of intergroup bias in smile discrimination and mimicry. \nMethods:  Thirty-three  adults  were  randomly  assigned  to two mutually  exclusive  groups  using  a minimal  group \nparadigm (e.g., Howard & Rothbart, 1980).  Participants completed 72 trials of the smile task, judging if the person \nin the video  was really happy or pretending, and 72 trials of a gender task (male or female).  In both tasks, stimuli \nwere short videos of ingroup or outgroup members.  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with 80 channels \nwas used to record brain activity in the lateral frontal, temporal and occipital areas. Participants’ facial expression was \nvideo recorded while they watching the videos.   Data were preprocessed, grouped into 16 ROIs based on channel MNI \ncoordinates an d then analysed using a general linear model in NIRS-SPM. \nResults: The left MFG and bilateral dlPFC were more activated during ingroup smiles, while the right IFG was more \nactivated  during  outgroup  smiles.   Additionally,  the right  IFG and right  posterior  superior  temporal  sulcus  (pSTS) \nshowed  greater  activation  in the smile  task compared  with the gender  task.  The behavioural  results  showed  that \nparticipants were slower and less accurate in the smile task than in the gender task.  However, there was no difference \nbetween smile and gender tasks on facial mimicry. \nConclusion: By using a multimodal approach with fNIRS in a minimal group setting, the current study sheds light on \nhow intergroup bias manifests at behaviour, cognitive, and neural levels.  The fNIRS results validate the involvement \nof the mentalizing  network  in smile  discrimination.   Importantly,  intergroup  bias was observed  at the  neural  level: \ndifferent brain regions respond ed to ingroup and outgroup information differently.  However, neither behavioural nor \nfNIRS results provided evidence for mimicry which indicates people can understand others’ emotional states without \nmimicking them.  \nReferences \nEkman, P.

School of Biology, University of St. Andrew , KY16 9ST, Scotland  \n*jkainers@andrew.cmu.edu  \nAbstract:  Physiological response s to apnea involve  complex mechanisms to manage the distribution of \noxygen, theorized to increase in magnitude with facial submersion in water. The different effects of apnea  in \nwet conditions have been closely  studied in experienced free divers, but the responses of untrained \nindividuals to apnea under similar conditions are not well understood.  Our stud y, using near -infrared and \ndiffuse correlation spectroscopy, found that oxygen levels and blood flow increased significantly in cerebral \nregions but decreased in peripheral regions  during apnea. Submersion intensified these effects in the brain \nbut not in other regions . These findings help specify how the body adapts to oxygen deprivation, relevant for \nconditions like sleep apnea.  \n \nIntroduction:  The autonomic capacity to conserve oxygen and limit metabolic demand in response to apnea is a comple x \nsystem, involving several components. Sympathetic  activation is theorized  to cause peripheral vasoconstriction, resulting in \nincreased peripheral arterial pressure,  decreased cardiac  output,  and a subsequent redistribution of blood volume. On the other \nhand, parasympathetic  activation directly leads to a decrease in heart rate. Previous work with near-infrared spectroscopy \n(NIRS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy  (DCS) and other monitoring tools has shown that factors like splenic contraction, \nshifts in intrathoracic  pressure balance s, and cerebral autoregulation, might also play a role in the hemodynamic respons e. Here \nwe contrast short -term responses of peripheral to  cerebral regions and  apnea in fully to partially submerged environments.  \nMethods: We measured hemoglobin concentrations and blood flow changes in 10 healthy adults using frequency -domain \nNIRS (FD-NIRS) and DCS at frontal cerebral and frontal antebrachial regions, along with a pulse oximeter. Subjects underwent \n4 conditions: holding their breath after inhalation or exhalation, and either partially or fully submerged in a hypothermic \n(28.3°C) pool.  We analyzed oxy - and deoxyhemoglobin  concentrations  ([\"#$],[\"#]), tissue - and pulsatile -oxygen saturation  \n('($!,')$!),1 blood flow index (*+,), oxygen extraction fraction  \n($-+) and changes in metabolic rate of oxygen (./01$!)2. A post-\nhoc non-parametric cluster -based permutation test validated our \nfindings.   \nResults: Our data shows a significant increase for cerebral regions \nand decrease in peripheral regions for [!\"#],\t'($! and *+,. \nPeripheral data shows a significant increase in $-+ and decrease \nin .01$!, while cerebral measurements showed increases in all \nconditions for $-+ and only in full submersion in ./01$!. \nAdditionally, a significant increase in response magnitude for \ncerebral regions was observed  when fully submerged, while \nperipheral regions showed no significant difference between  \nsubmersion  conditions.   \nConclusion:  This report presents continuous hemodynamic \nmeasurements during voluntary apnea  in wet environments for \nuntrained individuals, which has not been documented previously.  \nOur data shows different dynamics for cerebral and peripheral \nregions, unveiling  a new understanding of apnea responses  and \nrecovery, as well as related medical conditions  and their underlying \npatholog y. Additionally, this work might support a new percep tion \nof the hemodynamic adaptations made to prolonged voluntary or \ninvoluntary apneas , such as happening in obstructive sleep apnea.  \n!\"#$ \t['] !\"#$ \t[']Δ\"#$ \tΔ\"#['(]Peripheral CerebralPartial Submersion Full SubmersionEnd-Inspiration Apnea\nΔ[*+, ]\nΔ[*+]BH-Start\nBH-Start\nBH-EndBH-End****\n-60-40-200 20 40 60 801001201050-5-105002500-250-500\n5002500-250-5001050-5-10\n-40-200 20 40 60 80100120Δ\"#$ \tΔ\"#['(] Δ*+,\t[-. /. ] Δ*+,\t[-. /. ]* ********\n**\n* **** ****\n* ****\n* ****A:\nB:\nFigure 1: [!\"#], [!\"] and &'( changes for A: \nCerebral and B: Peripheral Region s for end-\ninhalatio n partial ly and fully submersed conditions. 152 of 398",
    "Visual cognition and dyadic interactions in caregivers and \ninfants. \n \nAimee Theyera & Sobanawartiny Wijeakumara \n \na. School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, NG7 2RD, Nottingham, England, (U.K. )  \nPresenting Author email address: Aimee.Theyer@nottingham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigated whether there was an association between caregiver and infant \nvisual cognition , and how caregiver -infant dyadic interactions were linked to this association . Visual \ncognition was measured using the preferential looking task. Caregivers and infant s also engaged  in \nunstructured play with toys.  fNIRS was used to record b rain activation . We found that there was an \nassociation between caregiver and infant visual cognition during experimental paradigms, and an \nassociation between caregiver and infant behaviors during dyadic interactions.  Lastly, we find \nrobust links between visual cognition and dyadic behaviors in caregivers and infant s separately.  \n \nIntroduction:  The ability to sustain attention emerges in infancy, and steadily improves across childhood. Previous \nresearch has suggested that infan ts’ ability to sustain attention may be influenced by their caregiver s’ own attentional \nbehavior s. Here, we first inquired whether there was an association between caregiver visual cognition and infant \nvisual cognition . Second, we investigated whether the quality and quantity of dyadic interactions were linked to this \nassociation.  \n \nMethods: 91 caregivers (33. 5 ± 4.5 years) and 91 infants (25 1.3 ± 34.9 days)  participated in the study. To assess \nvisual cognition, both infants and their caregivers separately engaged with  age-appropriate variants of a preferential \nlooking task. During this task, two side -by-side flashing arrays of colored  shapes are presented. On one side, one shape \nrandomly changes in color  between each flash, and on the other side, the colors  of the shapes remain the same. Memory \nload was manipulated  across 1  (low) , 2 (medium)  or 3 (high)  items for infa nts, and 4  (low) , 6 (medium)  or 8 (high)  \nitems for caregivers. Change preference (CP) score, a measure of preference for the changing side, was calculated \nfrom infant and caregiver eye -movement data . Additionally, caregivers were also asked to engage their infants through \n5- to 7-minute  unstructured play interactions with toys. From these interactions, proportion of caregiver and infant \nlooks, touch and verbalizations/vocalizations were extracted . From these measures, bouts of joint attention  between \ncaregivers and infants and sustained attention in the infant was calculated. fNIRS was used to record brain function \nduring the visual cognition task and dyadic interactions. Image reconstruction techniqu es were used to analyze fNIRS \ndata. Linear effects modelling was used to examine the link between behavior and brain function  in both caregivers \nand infants . \n \nResults: First, w e found that caregiver visual cognition was linked to infant visual cognition, both at the level of \nbeha vior and brain.  At the low load, caregiver CP scores were  positively associated with infant CP scores . Further, \ncaregiver CP scores were also positively linked to infant left superior parietal activation , a region associated with \nvisual working memory maintenance  in infants . Second, w e observed caregiver -infant associations during dyadic \ninteractions.  Joint attention between caregivers and infants was predictive of sustained attention in infants. Lastly, we \ndid not observe any direct links between caregiver -infant visual cognition and caregiver -infant dyadic interactions. \nHowever, we observed associations between visual cognition and dyadic behaviors in caregivers and infants \nseparately. Specifically, in caregivers, a higher proportion of looks, touch and verbalizations during dyadic interactions \nwas associated with a higher CP score in the preferential  looking task. Further, in infants, a higher proportion of looks \nand touch was associated with greater right superior parietal activation in the preferential looking task.  \n \nConclusion:  Our findings collectively show that visual cognition assessed through experimental methods is linked to \nbehaviors during dyadic interactions in caregivers and children, as early as the first year of life.  \n153 of 398",
    "Spatial Localization: Developing Earlier Than We Thought? \nCo-Location of Audio -Visual Stimuli in Infants  \nNadeen Kherbawy, Yotam Zigler, Hagar Daniels, Romi Livne, Sagi Jaffe -Dax \nSchool of Psychological Sciences and Sagol  School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University  \nkherbawy@mail.tau.ac.il  \nAbstract: Spatial localization of sounds is crucial for survival. Infants might be able to spatially \nlocalize their acoustical surroundings from early on, but their limited control over head movements \nprevents us from observing this ability. We tested whether infa nts possess sound localization \nabilities by presenting them with audio -visual stimuli that were either co -located or dislocated, while \nrecording brain activity in the temporal and frontal cortices. When comparing their responses, we \nfound a differe nce in their brain activity between the two conditions, suggesting that the location of \nsounds is indeed processed in their cortex.  \nIntroduction:  Infants’ display of spatial awareness remains a debatable topic within the field of developmental \npsychology. The common assumption regarding co -location of stimuli is that it develops within the first year of life. \nWhile some studies found a difference i n looking time between 4 - and 6 month old infants1, other studies have found \nno difference comparing 2 -, 5-, and 8 month -olds2. However, these studies have not examined the underlying neural \nmechanism of this sound  localization ability. Here, we  test infants’ ability to locate sounds  using fNIRS . In our study \nwe read a children’s book to infants, having 16 fixed places in the book for co -located vs. dislocated audio -visual \nstimuli while recording their brain activity. We hypothesized that there would be a difference in the frontal cortex \nbetween the Matched and Mismatched conditions, while in the temporal cortex no such difference will be found.   \nMethods:  Twenty infants aged 2.4 - 6.6 months (9 girls,  Mean = 4.63, SD = 1.22 ) were read a children's book \n(“Monkey Puzzle” by Julia Donaldson). The experimenter told the story through a monkey puppet. During the story, \nthe “monkey” moved to one side of the experimenter and made squeaking sounds, which either came from behind the \nmonkey (Matched condition), or from the other side of the experimenter (Mismatched condition). We compared \ninfants’ cortical activity in response to Match vs. Mismatch audio -visual conditions using a GLM (Satori, NIRx).  \nResults: We found a significant difference between the Matched \nand the Mismatched conditions in both the frontal cortex ( t = 2.1, p \n< 0.05 ; Fig. 1 ) and the temporal cortex ( t = 1.88, p < 0.05 ; Fig. 2 ). \nConclusion:  We conclude that brain activity significantly differs \nbetween Matched and Mismatched conditions in both cortices. \nAccording to our hypothesis, the difference in the frontal cortex \nreflects that infants do develop co -localization of audio -visual \nstimuli du ring the first 6 months of life. Moreover, the difference \nfound in the temporal cortex may stem from top -down processes in \nthe frontal cortex. More research needs to be done before reaching \na conclusive conclusion as some questions arise: Does this \ngeneral ize to other types of stimuli (e.g. tactile)? Do other abilities \ncorrelated with spatial localization develop earlier than assumed?   \n1. Thomas, R. L. et al. Sensitivity to auditory -tactile colocation in \nearly infancy.

With no empirical data pertaining to mother -father INS during \ncooperative gameplay with their child, this study aims to explore the role of parent -parent INS on \ninterpersonal family dynamics. Using functional near -infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS) \nhyperscanning , INS from bilateral  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and temporo -parietal \njunction (TPJ) will be derived in conjunction with self -report questionnaires on parental traumatic \nexperiences as well as assessments of parent -parent and child -parent attachment. Findings will offer \nnew insights for clinical practice and family assistance  programs.  \n \nIntroduction:  Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) is a potential correlate  of neurobiological alignment during social \ninteractions, reflecting interaction and relationship quality. While previous research focused on parent -child INS, no \nstudy has explored mother -father  INS during cooperative gameplay with their child. This research therefore \ninvestigates INS between parents playing Jenga with their 4 -8-year-old child. Jenga requires effective communication, \ncoordination, shared decision -making, and mutual prediction, wh ich have all been related to INS.  \n \nMethods: The study will utilise a non -invasive technique, functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) that \nindirectly measures changes in cerebral blood  flow, in 60 families . Data from bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \n(dlPFC) and temporo -parietal junction (TPJ) will be collected and INS derived from Wavelet Transform Coherence \n(WTC) analysis. Control for spurious correlation will be achieved through random permutation analysis.  \n \nPast experiences exert an influen ce on existing relationships and serve as a means of reflection of our current self. \nTherefore, the analysis of INS will be conducted in conjunction with validated self -report questionnaires pertaining to \nparental prior traumatic experiences as well as  assessing parent -parent and child -parent attachment, parental reflective \nfunctioning and couple functioning.  \n \nResults: Current literature emphasises that higher parent -child INS during cooperative interactions is not always better \nbut may also reflect interac tion and relationship difficulties  (Nguyen et al., 2024) . The present study therefore asks \nwhether the same principle applies to parent -parent INS, which variables may associate with (too) low or (too) high \nINS, and what these associations mean fo r interpersonal family dynamics. Accordingly, it is expected that (too) low \nor (too) high levels of parental synchrony may reflect  interaction and/or relationship difficulties.  Data acquisition will \ntake place during spring and summer of 20 24, with prelimi nary results available by September 2024.  \n \nConclusion:  The outcomes of this research may contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms \nunderlying parent -parent interactions whilst in the pres ent of their child. Understanding the links between INS, \nattachment styles and traumatic experiences may have significant implications for interventions aimed at supporting \nhealthy relationships within the family and promoting a healthy environment for chi ld well -being and development. \nThis may provide valuable insights for clinical practice and family assistance  programs , and  become a catalyst for \nfuture  studies that will involve families with parents or children who are  diagnosed with acute, chronic or even \ncomplex trauma.   \n \nReference  \nNguyen, T., Kungl, M.

Despite the prevalence, the impact of Chicha on cognitive and neural \ndevelopment has not been studied. A 68 -channel NIRSport2 montage was used,  and a resting -state \nconnectivity analysis will be  performed  on all channels . Preliminar y results  indicated  a notable lack \nof connectivity from the medial P FC and higher connectivity in D orsal regions . We expect \nconnectivity patterns to be moderated by children ’s Chicha consumption . \nIntroduction:  Chicha is a very common fermented  (alcoholic)  beverage in the Amazonian region  of Ecuador . It is \noften used as a nutritional supplement for children ages four months and older in low income and rural communities; \nespecially when there is limited or no food for the children to eat1. Despite how common it is  in many areas , there is \nvery limited research on the impact of chich a on cognitive and neural development. The purpose of this project was \nto explore potential differences in resting -state functional connectivity across different cortical regions in the brain \nbased on consumption rates of chicha.  \nMethods: Data for this study were collected from an ongoing investigation in two sites of the Ecuadorian Amazon \n(Shushufindi and Coca). Participants were 40 children  aged 3 – 5 (M = 4.14, SD = 0.52 ). Mothers and fathers reported \non child chicha consumption . Resting state stimuli2 were  presented  using PsychoPy3. fNIRS data was collected with \nthe NIRx NIRSport 2 unit using a 68 -channel  montage (24 sources 21 detectors).  Data w ere pre-processed with the \nBrain AnalyzIR toolbox4 in Matlab . A full connectivity analyses with all channels will be conducted with th at same \ntoolbox.  \nPreliminary  Results: Preliminary analyses have shown high levels of PFC connectivity  across the sample ; however, \nthere is a noticeable  lack of connectivity from the medial PFC with other PFC regions . Analyses with respect to the \nimpact of Chicha consumption are ongoing and will soon be completed.  We expect to find higher levels of Chicha \nconsumption to be associated with reduced functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of children in the \nEcuadorian Amazon.  Specifically, we believe Chicha \nuse will attenuate  the existing connectivity in the Dors al \nregions of the PFC.  \nReferences:  \n1.Murphy , K. et al., (2023).

    "An AI-empowered, fNIRS -EEG BCI for Mental State \nClassification  \nJianan Chen, Tom Carlson, and Hubin Zhao  \nHUB of Intelligent Neuro -engineering (HUBIN), Aspire CREATe, IOMS, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science (DSIS), University \nCollege London (UCL)  \nPresenting Author email address: jianan.chen.22@ucl.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  This study utilizes High -Density Diffuse Optical Tomography (HD -DOT) to evaluate \nmental fatigue by examining hemoglobin  variations in the brain  among healthy participants. We \nachieved high classification accuracy using Support Vector Machines (SVM), with results showing \nan average of 90% accuracy in distinguishing levels of fatigue. While the current system solely \nemploys HD -DOT, future work will  integrate electroencephalography (EEG) to enhance its \ncapability. This multimodal Brain -Computer Interfaces  (BCIs) approach aims to improve both \nspatial and temporal resolution, offering a more comprehensive tool for real -time brain activity \nmonitoring and mental state classification.  \nIntroduction:  The integration of various neuroimaging technologies has significantly advanced the field of Brain -\nComputer Interfaces (BCIs). Since functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS ) is not affected by electromagnetic \ninterference and is not as susceptible to movement artifacts as  electroencephalography  (EEG ), these two \ncomplementary modalities can be combined, providing a promising avenue to study the spatial, temporal, \nhemodynamic and metabolic characteristics of brain [1]. Currently, our study has leveraged HD -DOT to assess mental \nstates, particularly focusing on mental fatigue. The goal is to extend this research by incorporating EEG to enhance \nthe robustness and accuracy of the system, thereby creating a multimodal BCI tha t better captures the complex \ndynamics of the human brain.  \nMethods: In this phase of research, we utilized HD -DOT due to its high spatial resolution and minimal susceptibility \nto electromagnetic interference, qualities that make it ideal for accurate monitoring of cerebral blood flow and \noxygenation  [2]. Participants were monitored under varied states of mental fatigue in a controlled environment to \nensure consistent and reliable data collection. Data preprocessing involved channel selection to optimize signal quality, \nfollowed by dimensionality reductio n using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to facilitate \nmore effective data analysis.  \nResults: The classification of mental states was performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which \ndemonstrated high efficiency in distinguishing between low and high mental fatigue states. The HD -DOT -based \nmodels achieved an average accuracy of 90%, highlightin g the potential of this technology for precise mental state \nmonitoring. Although these results are promising, they also indicate the necessity for a more comprehensive approach \nthat could include EEG data to cover aspects such as electrical activi ty of the brain, which are not captured by HD -\nDOT alone.  \nConclusion  and future work: The successful implementation of HD -DOT in our current studies has set a solid \nfoundation for the development of a sophisticated multimodal BCI. The next steps involve integrating EEG to enhance \nthe temporal resolution and overall effectiveness of the system. This addition is expected to mitigate the limitations \nposed by each individ ual technology and to provide a more holistic view of brain activity, potentially leading to more \naccurate and reliable BCIs suitable for both clinical and non -clinical applications. Future work will focus on testing \nthe combined system in simulated enviro nments to ensure its applicability in real -world scenarios.  \nReferences  \n1.Cooper, R. J. et al.

Data from  \n15 adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 23 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus \n(iNPH) were used for training. The TBI model achieve d an average accuracy  of 4.1 mmHg, \nwhile 5.6 mmHg for the iNPH model . Integrating local and temporal features, this approach \ndemonstrates promising accuracy in ICP prediction across diverse  patient profiles. Future work \naims to enhance model performance through expanded data collection . \nIntroduction : Effective management of severe cerebral pathologies requires continuous intracranial pressure\n(ICP) monitoring, typically done through invasive methods . Due to possible risks associated , there  is a growing \ninterest in non -invasive alternatives  [1, 2] . Fischer et al. [1] used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on non-\ninvasive cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals from diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to predict ICP . We \npropose a hybrid model combining a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Recurrent Neural Network \n(RNN) to capture local patterns and tempo ral evolution  in CBF signals for better ICP estimation.  \nMethods: Data were collected from adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and idiopathic normal pressure\nhydrocephalus (iNPH). Fast DCS data, recorded at approximately 40 Hz, were acquired from the frontal lobes. \nSimultaneously, ICP was monitored using an intraparenchymal sensor in TBI patients and a  subdural sensor in \niNPH . The acquired data were used to train two hybrid CNN -RNN model s, one for each cohort . CBF data from \nDCS served as input, with gr ound truth ICP values derived from the invasive  sensors. A leave -one-out evaluation  \nmethod was used to assess the model. In each fold, training on n-1 subset of subjects and testing on the remaining \nsubject ensured better  performance evaluation. The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for each fold \nby comparing the measured ICP sensor values with the model predictions on the test subset.  \nResults: Two models were\ntrained, each with 15 TBI and 23 \niNPH patients, respectively. \nUsing a leave -one-out evaluation \nmethod , the TBI model achieved \nan average RMSE of 4.1 mmHg \nacross 15 folds, ranging from 1 \nmmHg to 13 mmHg, while the \niNPH model an average RMSE of \n5.6 mmHg across 23 folds, \nranging from 2 mmHg to 20 \nmmHg.

This study explores the potential of fNIRS technology to address this iss ue. Participants \ndiagnosed with MDD, BP, and healthy controls underwent cognitive task while hemodynamic \nresponses were measured using fNIRS. Significant differences were observed in age, education, and \ntask performance among groups. Hemodynamic features showed promise in distinguishing \nindividuals with psychiatric disorders  from healthy controls.  \n \nIntroduction:  The challenges in identifying and differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder \n(BP) early on due to their similar symptoms. Traditional neuromonitoring tools are limited by cost and space \nconstraints. A study used fMRI and PET scans to detect differences in brain function during cognitive stimulation \nbetween MDD, BP, and normal individuals  [1]. In this study, we employed fNIRS technology due to its affordability \nand user -friendly , aiming to validate its potential as an adjunctive tool in distinguishing various psychiatric disorders.  \n \nMethods: The study recruited participants diagnosed with  MDD , BP, and healthy controls (HC) using standard \nmethods such as DSM -IV criteria, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) \nscore. Each group consisted of 30 individuals, with HC averaging 32 years old, MDD averaging 48 years old, and BP \naveraging 28 years old. Participants completed a verbal fluency task involving pre -task, task, and post -task periods, \nwith specific instructions for each phase  [2]. The u sed fNIRS system is a NIRSIT (OBELAB Inc., Korea) and it is \ncomposed by 24 lasers sources (780/850 nm) and 32 photo detectors . The hemodynamics responses extracted by \nmodified beer -lambert law  and integral  features  to identify individuals with major diagnose s. Data analysis involved \nANOVA to assess group differences in variables and ANCOVA to control for age, education, and task performance \neffects on fNIRS features.  \n \nResults: One-way ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences between groups regarding age and years of \neducation, indicating that individuals with MDD tended to be older than those in the BP and HC groups (F = 14.664, \np < 0.005). Regarding task performance, the  total number of valid words generated during the task was similar between \nthe MDD and HC groups and higher than the BP group (F = 5.622, p < 0.005). Significant differences among groups \nwere found in the  hemodyn amic feature , with post -hoc analyses showing significant differences between HC and each \npsychiatric disorder group (HC vs BP, HC vs MDD; p < 0.05).  \n \nConclusion:  This fNIRS study aims to explore the potential of fNIRS as a practical tool for distinguishing between \nhealthy individuals and those diagnosed with major psychiatric disorders. It is demonstrated that utilizing the features  \nfrom hemoglobin changes have a potential in distinguishing psychiatric disorders  from healthy controls . These \nfindings suggest that fNIRS has the potential to serve as a promising biomarker in the process of differentiating \nindividuals with mood or psychosis disorders, marking a significant step towards tailoring treatments based on \nindividual needs.  \n \nReferences \n1.

    "Reliability of fNIRS during a language task in people with aphasia  \nJeffrey P. Johnson1, Hendrik Santosa2, Michael W alsh Dickey1,2, William D. Hula1,2, and Theodore Huppert2 \n1VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 2University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA  \n1jeffrey.johnson9@va.gov \nAbstract: There is growing interest in using fNIRS  to study aphasia, a language disorder caused by \nstroke, but the reliability of fNIRS in people with aphasia has not been established . We administered \na language task to eight adults with aphasia during two fNIRS sessions. Several indices indicated \nthat reliability was fair for the group, but poor for individual subjects and channels. Investigators \nwho use this task with fNIRS should limit inferences to the group level and employ strategies to \nverify that longitudinal changes are valid,  and are not due to n ormal session -to-session variability.  \nIntroduction: Aphasia, a language disorder commonly caused by stroke, negatively affects communication and \nquality of life. fMRI  is often used to study aphasia and its treatment , but has notable limitations , making fNIRS an \nappealing alternative . However, its test-retest reliability (TRTR) in this population has not been established, \nrepresenting a threat to the validity of aphasia research, especially longitudinal studies . We evaluate d the TR TR of \nfNIRS during a language task that has previously been validated in p eople with aphasia (PWA) using fMRI1. \nMethod: Eight adults with aphasia performed a  language task1 during two fNIRS sessions four days apart. The task \nincludes two conditions: word -relatedness judgment  and symbol matching . Data were collected with a 16x16 optode \narray with coverage of  bilateral language areas , plus  8 short -separation detectors. Subject -level HbO and HbR were \nanalyzed with an autoregressive iterative least squares GLM2. Group -level mixed effects models were used for each \nsession . TRTR was calculated using subject - and group -level t-statistics for the contrast words -symbols  at sessions 1 \nand 2, and following Huang et al3, it was examined mapwise  (whole montage)  and channelwise  (each individual \nchannel) via ICC s, and  clusterwise  (in sets of channels with the largest effect s for words -symbols ) using Roverlap3, which \nwas calculated for the top 10 , 20, 30, and 40 percent  of channels.  TR TR was interpreted per the following benchmarks4: \nexcellent: >0.75; g ood: 0.59 -0.75; fair: 0.40 -0.58; poor: <0.40.  \nResults: Mapwise  TRTR  for the group was fair for HbO  [ICC = 0.51] and HbR  [ICC = 0.47]. Within subjects, it was \nvariable, but poor on average  for HbO [ICC M(SD) = 0.08 ( 0.28)] and HbR [ICC M(SD) = 0.18 (0.26)]. Cluster w ise  \nTRTR for the group was fair  for HbO when including the top 30% and 40% of channels (R overlap = 0.42  and 0.56, \nrespectively), but poor at higher percentiles ; for HbR, it was fair (0.50) at all four percentiles. For individual  subjects, \nclusterwise  TRTR was fair only when the top 40% of channels were included \nfor HbO [Roverlap  M(SD) = 0.41  (0.13 )] and HbR [Roverlap  M(SD) = 0.48  \n(0.14 )]. Channelwise  ICCs were variable  and poor on average  (Fig. 1) . \nConclusions: Reliability was acceptable at the group level, but poor f or \nsubjects and channels. Researchers using this task to measure treatment -\nrelated change should restrict interpret ations to  group  effects , avoiding  \ninferences about individual s and channels . We al so reco mmend multiple pr e-\ntreatment  scans  to obtain a benchmark for comparison to post -treatment \nchanges.  This work is ongoing , but these preliminary results support the use \nof this task  with fNIRS in PWA , with the caveats noted above .  \nReferences : \n1.Wilson, S. M., Yen, M. & Eriksson, D. K.

This study investigated the potential of \nevaluating CO by measuring cerebral blood flow  using diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) . Five \nbeagle dogs  underwent simultaneous  measure ment of cerebral blood flow and CO using  a head \nmounted  DCS probe  and an aortic flow sensor attached to the ascending aorta , respectively, during  \na simulated hypovolemic shock  and recovery. Although c erebral blood flow showed  an overall \nsignificant correlat ion with CO changes,  some dogs showed a hysteresis response , suggesting \nimpaired autoregulatory function  of cerebral vessels  by hemorrhagic shock . \n \nIntroduction:  Comprehensive monitoring of systemic \ncirculatory s tatus  is essential i n the acute care setting . \nAlthough  CO i s the most reliable indicator of central \ncirculatory s tatus , the invasive nature of CO measurement \nlimits its use in the practice  and noninvasive CO monitoring \ntechniques are needed . Recently, DCS has attracted attention \nas a device that can noninvasively and continuously measure \nblood flow velocity  in deep tissue . We investigate d the \nfeasibility of assessing  CO by monitoring cerebral blood flow \nusing DCS in a canine  model of hypovolemic shock.  \n \nMethods:  Hypovolemic shock and its recovery were induced \nin five beagle dogs under anesthesia by withdrawing and \nreturning approximately 30 mL/kg of blood. A DCS probe \nwith a source -detector separation of 2.5 cm was placed on the \nshaved skin areas of the head. An a ortic flow sensor was \nplaced on the ascending aorta to monitor CO. Blood flow \nindex (BFI ) and CO values were calculated every second and normalized by z -score. Pearson correlation analysis was \nperformed on  the data including the period s of pre-treatment rest, blood withdrawal, hypovolemic shock, blood return, \nand post -treatment rest.  \n \nResults: Both BFI and CO decreased by the blood withdrawal and were remained lower under hypovolemic state. \nWith the blood return, both BFI and CO recovered toward pre -treatment resting levels.  The mean correlation \ncoefficient between head BFI and CO was 0.94 (SD = 0.02,  p < 0. 01 in all dogs ). Three  dogs (No . 3, 4, and 5 in \nFigure 1)  showed hysteresis in the relationship between BFI and CO, with BFI lower during blood return than \nduring blood withdrawal  at the same level of CO , suggesting  an impaired autoregulatory responses  of the cerebral \nvessels due to the hemorrhagic shock.  \n \nConclusion : Continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity using DCS shows promise as a noninvasive \nmethod for assessing CO, with a strong correlation observed in a canine model of hypovolemic shock. Variability in \nBFI values between  blood withdrawal and return perio ds suggests potential utility in detecting circulatory dysfunction. \nFurther investigation is necessary to ascertain the feasibility of CO estimation by BFI.   \nFigure 1: Relationship between BFI and CO  \nduring  hemorrhagic shock and recovery  \n161 of 398",
    "The Impact of Project -Based Scripts on Neural Synchronization  of \nTriadic collaboration  within STEM Education Context \n \nFergie Yu Wanga, Yuxuan Zhangb, Mingming Zhangb, Wei-Peng Teo c, Yan Donga* \n \naSchool of Education Technology, Beijing Normal University, 19 Xinjiekouwai Street, Haidian District, Beijing , China  \nbCollege of Psychology, Shanghai Normal University, No. 100, Guilin Rd., Xuhui District, Shanghai, China  \ncPhysical Education and Sports Science Academic Group, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University , 1 Nanyang Wa lk, \nSingapore  \nAbstract:   \nThis study explores the effect of project -based collaboration scripts on inter-neural synchronizatio n \n(INS) and task performance in three -person STEM engineering  design. this study employs a \nhyperscanning experiment involving triadic interactions, collecting neural activity data from the \nparticipants' cortical regions, conversational data during collaboration, subjective perception \nmeasures before and after each task, and performance scores of the task outcomes (product design ) \nunder two experimental conditions —with and without project -based collaboration scripts . Key \nfindings include significant enhancements in task performance and INS  in the r -TPJ, with \nsynchronization in the superior temporal gyrus which significantly predicting task success.  \n \nIntroduction:  Although research into the neural mechanisms of dyadic interactions has enriched our understanding \nof how two brains work in sync during collaboration, real -world educational scenarios often involve teams of three or \nmore members  especially in comprehensive STEM projects, which better represent diversity and complexity. This \nstudy aims to conduct strategic intervention research. It introduces \"scaffolding guidance\" in the form of collaboration \nscripts, which are crucial for teachin g and practicing STEM engineering design . These scripts are pre -designed \nlearning scenarios and interaction guidelines intended to enhance learning efficiency and quality by fostering effective \ncommunication and cooperation among students.  \n \nMethods: This study employs an fNIRS hyperscanning methodology, forming subjects into trios to complete two \nproduct design tasks under two experimental conditions: with and without the support of project -based scripts. Similar \nto the first study, we collected data on neural activity in the cortical regions of the brain, conversational data during \ncollaboration, subjective perception measures before and after each task, and performance scores of the task outcomes \n(product design drawings). Using Wavelet Transform Coh erence (WTC) analysis, t -tests, and correlational analyses, \nwe conducted a joint analysis of INS, frequency of interaction behaviors, subjective measurement indices, and task \nperformance scores. This approach revealed the impact of project -based collaboration scripts on neural \nsynchronization mechanisms, interaction behavior characteristics, and task  performance during the STEM engineering \nprocess in three -person collaborations.  \n \nResults: The results showed that in the frequency band of interest  \n0.0122 to 0.0172 Hz, there was no significant increase in INS under \nthe \"free collaboration\" condition without collaboration script , \ncompared to the resting state. However, under the \"project -based \ncollaboration\" condition, significant increases in INS were obse rved \nin CH13, 16, and 21, all of which are located in the r-TPJ. Besides , a \nSpearman  correlation analysis was conducted between the INS in the \nthree channels from project-based collaboration  and their average \nneural synchronization with the task performance scores. The results \nindicated that neural synchronization at CH16 significantly correlated \nwith the team's final product in terms of STEM knowledge integration (r  = 0.692, p = 0.002), creativity (r  = 0.595, p \n= 0.012), aesthetics (r  = 0.497, p = 0.042), and overall score (r  = 0.655, p = 0.004). Additionally, INS at channel 21 \nwas significantly correlated with the technical aspects of the design product (r  = 0.504, p = 0.039).  \n \nConclusion:  The find ings of t his study not only enrich the interactive brain hypothesis but also demonstrate that neural \nsynchronization in the r -TPJ during interdisciplinary engineering design reflects a shared understanding and \ncoordinated cognitive processing of the design task among team me mbers. Additionally, the effectiveness of project -\nbased collaboration scripts in the collaborative process has been validated, providing reliable neural markers for \neducational intervention strategies.     \nFigure: INS in CH21,  CH16 and CH13 w ere \nsignificantl y increased in the project -based \ncollaboration . \nCH21CH16\nCH13\nProject –based collaboration \nCH21 CH16\nCH13\nFree collaboration (control) \n162 of 398",

In  this  study,  we  compare  MCI  patients  to  age-matched  controls  using \n Time-Domain  functional  Near-Infrared  Spectroscopy  (TD-fNIRS)  brain  recordings  at  rest  and \n during  a  cognitive  task.  We  found  multiple  metrics  that  differentiated  the  two  groups,  including \n absolute  oxygenation,  fractional  Amplitude  of  Low  Frequency  Fluctuations  (fALFF),  a nd \n behavioral  metrics.  Future  work  will  include  building  a  classification  model  for  MCI  based  on \n brain metrics.   \n Introduction:  Current  estimates  suggest  that  over  90%  of  patients  with  mild  cognitive  impairment  (MCI)  are  not \n diagnosed  due  to  a  lack  of  diagnostic  tools  available  at  primary  care  (  1  )  .  There  is  therefore  an  urgent  need  to  devel op \n new  objective  screening  tools  to  assist  with  early  detection  of  MCI.  Time-domain  functional  near-infrared \n spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) can be used to measure brain function in clinical settings, and may fill this need. \n Methods:  MCI  patients  (n=46,  age=73.02±7.60)  and  control  older  adults  (HC;  n=47,  age=67.43±7.83)  participated \n in  brain  recordings  using  TD-fNIRS  duri ng  rest  and  a  cognitive  task  implicated  in  MCI:  the  Verbal  fluency  task \n (VFT)  consisting  of  interleaved  blocks  reciting  words  (control:  weekdays;  semantic:  words  from  a  given  category; \n phonological:  words  starting  with  a  given  letter).  Raw  data,  i.e.  the  distributions  of  the  times  of  flight  (DToFs)  of \n photons  at  two  wavelengths  (690  and  905nm),  underwent  standard  preprocessing  to  obtain  changes  in  the \n concentrations  of  oxygenated/deoxygenated  hemoglobin  (HbO/HbR),  and  absolute  chromophore  concentrations \n (  2  –  4  )  . Features related to brain function as well  as behavioral metrics during VFT were extracted. \n Results:  First,  we  looked  for  features \n that  significantly  differentiated \n between  MCI  and  HC  grou ps  during  a \n resting  state  session  (watching  a \n 7-minute  audiovisual  segment). \n Multiple  features,  including  absolute \n HbO  and  prefrontal  fractional \n Amplitude  of  Low  Frequency \n Fluctuations  (fALFF)  were  statistically \n different  between  MCI  and  HC  (Figure \n 1a,b).  Next,  we  explored  the  VFT  task \n both  in  terms  of  behavior  and  neural \n features.  Behavior  was  sig nificantly \n different  between  groups  (Fig.  1c), \n which  is  expected  from  prior  literature \n (  5  )  .  Activation  maps  were  quantified \n using  Generalized  Linear  Models \n (GLM).  Independent  t-test  on  pooled \n GLM  test  statistics  (HC  -  MCI) \n revealed areas with significant differences between the two groups (Fig. 2D). \n Conclusion:  We  demonstrated  significant  group-level  dif ferences  between  MCI  vs  healthy  controls  using \n TD-fNIRS.  With  ongoing  data  collection,  we  seek  to  validate  these  findings  and  employ  classification  techniques  for \n MCI screening.  References: \n 1.  S.

In  this  study,  we  measured  depression \n patients  longitudinally  using  Time-Domain  functional  Near-Infrared  Spectroscopy  (TD-fNIRS) \n brain  recordings  at  rest  and  during  a  cognitive  task.  Patients  were  measured  before  they  started \n treatment,  after  the  first  treatment,  and  at  the  end  of  treatment,   and  additional  clinical  and \n self-report  data  was  collected.  We  found  metrics  that  differentiated  treatment  responders  from \n remitters,  including  neural  responses  during  a  verbal  fluency  task.  Future  work  will  include \n building a classification model for predicting depression treatment response.  \n Introduction:  Depression  is  a  neuropsychiatric  disorder  affecting  tens  of  millions  of  Americans  and  hundreds  of \n millions  of  people  world-wide.  A  large  proportion  of  patients  do  not  respond  to  their  first  treatment  and  a  subset  of \n those  do  not  respond  to  multiple  treatments,  indicating  they  have  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD).  Currently \n there  are  no  quantitative  tools  for  predicting  treatment  response  at  a n  individual  level  that  could  help  guide  clinician \n treatment  decisions  across  multiple  treatment  options.  Time-domain  functional  near-infrared  spectroscopy \n (TD-fNIRS) can be used to objectively measure brain function in clinical settings, and may fill this need. \n Methods:  TRD  patients  (N=15)  completed  a  longitudinal  study  consisting  of  brain  recordings  using  TD-fNIRS  \n during  rest  and  a  cognitive  task.  The  verbal  fluency  task  (VFT)  had  a  block  design  with  interleaved  blocks  reciting \n words  (control:  weekdays;  phonological:  words  starting  with  a  given  letter).  Patients  were  measured  before  they \n started  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS)  treatment  for  depression,  after  their  first  treatment,  and  before  their \n last  treatment.  At  the  end  of  the  TMS  treatment  course,  clinicians  reported  if  patients  had  responded  to  the  treatment, \n had remitted due to the treatment, or showed no response. Data collection is ongoing. \n Raw  data,  i.e.  the  distributions  of  the  times  of  flight  (DToFs)  of  photons  at  two  wavelengths  (690  and \n 905nm),  underwent  standard  preprocessing  to  obtai n  moments  of  DToFs  and  corresponding  changes  in  the \n concentrations  of  oxygenated/deoxygenated  hemoglobin  (HbO/HbR),  along  with  absolute  chromophore \n concentrations  (  1  –  3  )  .  Brain  activation  patterns  were  quantified  with  a  Generalized  Linear  Model  (GLM)  (  2  )  . \n Differences  in  pre-treatment  brain  activity  between  remitters  (n=  6)  and  responders  (n =  9)  during  the  phonological \n blocks were quantified with an independent t-test (i.e. remitters - responders). \n Results:  Preliminary  results  demonstrated  regions \n of  differentiated  brain  activity  between  remitters \n and  responders,  particularly  in  the  right  temporal \n region  for  HbO  and  right  prefrontal  region  and  left \n temporal region for HbR (Fig 1). \n Conclusion:  Latera lized  brain  activity  may  be \n particularly  important  in  predicting  response  to \n depression  treatments,  which  may  be  linked  to  the \n known  laterality  of  depression  in  the  brain  (  4  )  . \n Future  work  will  compare  biomarkers  of  response  to \n different treatments. \n References \n 1.

    "Uncontrolled False Positives in Filtered fNIRS: A Critical \nExamination\nAnthony Zinos1, Julie C. Wagner1, Harry T. Whelan2,3 and Scott A.

Milwaukee, WI 53226 , 3Department  of Neurolog y, Children ’s Wisconsin, 8915 W \nConnell Ct, Milwaukee, WI 53226  \nPresenting Author Email: anthony.zinos @marquette .edu \nAbstract:  Filtering is a common preprocessing  method in  functional near infrared spectroscopy \n(fNIRS ) but  can lead to assumption violations in the statistical methods  used in fNIRS research . \nSimulated da ta with a variety of noise conditions tested whether th ese assumption violations lead to \nuncontrolled false positive rate (FPR) . Preprocessing with a filter led to a loss of false positive  \ncontrol for all  tested statistical methods  and measured  an FPR much higher than  the Į-level . We \nconclude that  filtering  should be avoided in combination with many common statistical approaches \nin fNIRS.  \nIntroduction:  In a typical scientific study, statistical methods are designed to achieve a pre -specified probability  (the \n“Į-level”)  of a false positive result. In the field of fNIRS one common  preprocessing method is filtering , which  is used \nto attenuate unwanted noise that contaminates the signals of interest. Filtering can improve the detectability of cerebral \nchanges and it is used frequently, with one study reporting filtering was used in 72.7% of surveyed (1). However, \nfiltering  fNIRS data can result in violations of  statistical model assumptions (2). The aim of this study is to \nquantitatively evaluate the effects of filtering on common fNIRS statistical methods, with a particular focus on FPR.  \nMethods: A total of 40 blocks of 5 -minute resting state fNIRS data was collected from four participants over 10 \nsessions. All fNIRS data was collected via a rectangular grid array of 32 emitters and 32 detectors (102 channels, \nsampled at 3.125Hz) over the entire scal p. To ensure results w eren’t specific to the tested participants , pink noise with \na power spectral density  (PSD)  of 1/𝑓𝛾 was generated, where the parameter Ȗ was chosen to best fit the observed PSD \nof the measured resting state data. The pink noise was generated with the same number of samples as those present in \nthe 5-minute recordings . Gaussian white noise was also generated with the same length  for comparison , since Gaussian \nwhite noise meets the assumptions of the GLM . The real resting state data, pink noise and white noise conditions were \nall analyzed using a n ordinary least squares general linear model ( OLS GLM) , and an autoregress ive iteratively \nreweighted least squares  GLM  (AR-IRLS GLM) (3). The GLM design matrix was designed as if to test for a stimulus \nresponse, with a boxcar function of 20 second period convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF). \nTherefore, all posit ive findings of the GLM in this case are false positives. All channels of real data, and 10,000 \n“channels” of simulated noise  were tested this way . Additional analyses were performed with lowpass, highpass, and \nbandpass filte ring applied to the signals prior to the GLM. The FPRs at an Į-level of 0.05 were tabulated across noise \nconditions, filter conditions,  and analysis methods.  \nResults: FPRs higher than the Į -level w ere observed whenever filtering was performed, even when using the more \nsophisticated AR -IRLS GLM, as shown in Figure 1. Highpass filtering was the least harmful, but it is also rarely \nperformed in fNIRS (1). FPRs in the OLS GLM case were higher in every case except white noise, as expected.  \nConclusion:  This study showed that filtering data \nbefore statistical analysis with a GLM leads to \nuncontrolled FPRs well above the specified  Į-level . \nThis could lead to inconsistent findings that are not \nreproducible, and so we strongly caution against \nfiltering fNIRS data prior to statistical analysis \nwithout first demonstrating that the statistical \nmethods are robust to the serial correlatio ns \ninduced by the filter. \nReferences:  \n1.

We use the frequency  \ndomain  NIRS and functional NIRS in Multiple Sclerosis  (MS)  and post-acute COVID -19 syndrome  \n(PACS) . We show that  cortical microvascula r hypo xia occurs  in MS and PACS and  that functional \nconnectivity may indicate brain function  and adaptations . NIRS can provide useful biomarkers in \nseveral pathologies that are associated with inflammation, h ypoxia, and reduced function .  \nIntroductio n: Brain structure and function disturbances are implicated in several pathologies. These pathologies  can \nbe better understood using  near-infrared spectroscopy  (NIRS ). We have applied NIRS to investigate the presence of \nhypoxia in the brains of people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), inflammatory bowel disease, stroke, concussion, and \nin those with post -acute COVID -19 syndrome (PACS). These  all have a commonality, which is the existence of \ninflammation. We hypothesize that there may be inflammatory responses within the brain that promote hypoxia \nthrough a progressive and self -perpetuating cycle and that this hypoxia will impact  brain function and quality of life.  \nMethods: We use frequency d omain NIRS to quantify hypoxia and functional NIRS to assess brain function using \nmeasures of functional coherence (FC). Here we present our application of these techniques in MS and PACS. For the \nMS study, we recruited pwMS and healthy controls (HCs) and compared their cortical microvascular oxygen \nsaturation (StO 2) and brain functional coherence (FC). For the PACS study, we recruited individuals after acute \nCOVID -19 infection, grouped them into reported persistent symptom (symptomatic) and no post -acute -symptom \ngroup (asymptomatic),  and compared their cortical microvascular StO2 and FC.  FC was computed in the  very-low-\nfrequency window (VLFW)  (0.01- 0.049 Hz ), which is associated with endothelial and neurogenic activities, and  in \nthe low-frequency window (LFW) (0.05-0.08 Hz ), which is related to myogenic activity .     \nResults: Our data showed that 45% of pwMS have cortical microvascular hypoxia, and those classified as hypoxic \nhave significantly lower interhemispheric FC values versu s normoxic pwMS. Within the VLFW, resting state \ninterhemispheric FC in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly different between groups (F(2,92)=4.98, p<0.05), \nwhere significant reduction was observed in hypoxic pwMS compared to normoxic pwMS (p<0.05 ) and HCs (p<0.05).  \nRegarding the PACS study, 22% of symptomatic (n=20) and 10.5% of asymptomatic participants (n=19) were \nhypoxic. During a speed -of-processing task (paced auditory serial addition task), FC in the LFW in all measured brain \nregions was sig nificantly higher in the \nasymptomatic compared with healthy controls  \nand for symptomatic groups when compared \nto controls  (Figure 1).  In PACS during \nPASAT, hypoxia was associated with \nincreased FC  (p=0.03 7). \nConclusion:  We have utilized NIRS -based \nmeasures to monitor brain hypoxia and \nfunction in conditions  that have an \ninflammatory component . An increase in the \nincidence of hypoxia was observed in MS \nand post -acute COVID -19. Brain function, as \nquantified with f unctional coherence was \naltered with symptoms or hypoxi a. NIRS  can \nprovide useful biomarkers in several \npathologies that are associated with \ninflammation, hypoxia , and reduced function.  \n166 of 398",

Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, UK.   \nPresenting Author email address: karol.poles@unito.it   \n \nAbstract:  Previous evidence showed that even at birth, multisensory integration (MSI) is spatially \norganized , as evidenced by enhanced electrophysiological responses when stimuli occur near the \nbody, pinpointing the  early  ability to localize the bodily -self in space1. Here, to un veil the neural \ncorrelates supporting  the emergence of b odily -self representation  early in life , we aim to adapt  the \npreviously employed EEG task in a n fNIRS version.  \n \nIntroduction:  A sensitivity to multimodal correspondences underpinning body representations has been found  early \nin postnatal life . Indeed, areas of the infant cortex that specifically respond to combined vis uo-tactile and visu o-\nproprioceptive  body -related stimuli  have been identified with fNIRS2. Moreover, a recent EEG study from our team1 \nshowed a distinctive electrophysiological  marker of multisensory integration ( MSI) in newborns , with  specific \nenhanced and  superadditive  ERP responses to bimodal compared to unimodal stimul i. Crucially , such pattern was also \nmodulated by the proximity to the body, with larger MSI effect when the stimuli occurred in the near compared to far \nspace  (body -proximity effect ). While EGG allowed us to understand the timing of underneath this mechanism, we \nstill do not know which brain regions  contributes to the emergence of MSI . To this end,  we adapted the event -related \nMSI audio -tactile  protocol previously employed with EEG to a fNIRS block -design task and we  will assess  the \nfeasibility of recording spatially modulated MSI hemo dynamic responses  in newborns and infants . Lastly , we will \ninvestigate the  related  key brain activations , highlighting the neural functional connectivity associated with the \nemergence of the spatial modulation of MSI.  \n \nMethods: For a first  feasibility test (N=1, 5 -months infant) , we used a NIRx  fNIRS system with 54 channel covering \nfrontal, parietal and temporal areas , known to be engaged in MSI2. The block -design  protocol consist s of the same \nfive conditions of stimulation employed in the EEG task1, with bimodal  audio -tactile (AT near, AT far) and unimodal  \naudio or tactile (A near, A far  and T) stimuli. The infant underwent 25 experimental trials (5 per condition) , alternated  \nwith baseline trials with a variable duration of 9 -12s. Each experimental trial (10s) consists of 8 uni - or bimodal \nstimulations with gittered  ISI ( 500-1000 ms). Raw data were pre -processed  with a standard infant data analysis \npipleine3 and the haemodynamic  response to the different conditions were obtained by block averaging trials.  \n \nResults: Figure 1 shows preliminary result s of changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated blood (HbO 2 and HHb ) in \nthe bimodal conditions  (AT far and AT near) in channel 9 ( approximately over temporal lobe ). Greater hemodynamic \nresponse  in the AT near compared to the AT far condition was found . Interestingly, there were no differences between \nA near and A far  conditions . \n \nConclusion:   \nHere, we successfully adapted  an EEG task aimed to assess \nMSI to an fNIRS block -design  task, suitable for infant \nstudies.  As next step, we aim to test (N=30 ) adults , \nnewborns  and 4-to-5 month s infants with this task to  \ndescribe the neural network associated with the spatial \nmodulation of MSI  and its emergence through development . \n \nReferences : \n1.

We exploit the bilinear model for flexible fNIRS data emulation. Our framework provides a \nrange of noise functions that integrate both fully synthetic and semisynthetic physiological and \ninstru mental noise through a coherent i nterface. This framework facilitates synthetic data generation \nwith implications for algorithm validation and enhancing the quality of pipelines.  \n \nIntroduction:  Synthetic data generation is necessary for validating models and operations in problems without access \nto ground truth by experimental means, such as when interrogating brain activity with fNIRS. Synthetic data \ngeneration is always a trade -off between the simplicity of the forward modelling and compliance with the required \nmodelling constraints. Many ad -hoc options are available to whoever needs to generate this data. However, using \ncurrent options often requires some degree of skillfulness or  programming skills. A non -coding interface for \ngenerating synthetic fNIRS data can democratise access. We have wrapped the bilinear model for fNIRS [1]  and a \ncollection of noise functions behind a user interface for quick and flexible synthetic data gene ration.  \n \nMethods. The bilinear model for fNIRS [1] is a three -level forward differential model beginning with neurodynamic \nstates, transitioning through hemodynamic representation, and culminating in the simulation of optical observations \n[1]. This baseline model has been enriched with \nan expandible library of physiological and \ninstrumental noise through two distinct sources: \nfully synthetic or semisynthetic.  Among the \nformer, we currently offer heart rate, breathing, \nand vasomotion [2] an d a generic coloured (inc \nwhite) noise model to simulate o ther \ndisturbances. Alternatively, the latter \nsemisynthetic noise utilises a default set of \nprecompiled resting state data [3], and additional \ndatasets can be seamlessly added. Finally, a \ngraphical user interface allows quick generation \nof batches of both s egregational and/or \nintegrational datasets and whether synthetic and \nsemisynthetic data with fine control of activity \nevoked or resting data with different noise \nproperties, e.g., variability, desired SNR, etc.  \n \nResults: Figure 1 illustrates exemplary data \ngenerated with our platform. This platform \nallows for direct visual representation of the \ngenerated data, exporting the (semi -)synthetic data, and streamlining synthetic fNIRS dataset creation and \nmanipulation. The code is available at https://github.com/MarSH -Up/Bilinear -model.  \n \nConclusion:  We have wrapped and enriched a synthetic fNIRS data generation solution, further combining user -\nfriendly interfaces.

    "Classifying Ankle Movements with fNIRS-BCI  \n \nHammad Nazeer1, Naqash Ahmad1, Noman Naseer1 \n \n1Department of Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering Air University Islamabad, Pakistan \nhammad@mail.au.edu.pk , naqash.ahmed@students.au.edu.pk , noman.naseer@mail.au.edu.pk   \n \nAbstract:  Maintaining the ability to move freely is essential, for a quality of life. As people age or \nface challenges like accidents, natural disasters or health conditions such as strokes they may \nexperience difficulties in moving mostly due to ankle issues. When there is an imbalance in the \nankle it can affect walking patterns. This research explores using infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to \ncontrol exoskeletons for aiding ankle movements,. Six statistical features and four machine learning \nclassifiers were tested, with the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier achieving 91.1% accuracy by \ncombining all features. To prevent overfitting, individualized optimal 'k' values for kNN were \ndetermined.  \nIntroduction:  In this research, fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) is utilized as a data acquisition modality \nfor a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. During the performance of an action, the brain requires oxygen to fire \nneurons, drawing oxygen from the blood and altering the concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood at that \nspecific point [1]. fNIRS measures this change in concentration. A typical BCI system involves several stages: data \nacquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. \n \nMethods: Twenty healthy participants underwent data acquisition using the NIRX \nNIRSport2 fNIRS system. The setup comprised 20 channels created from 8 pairs of \nsources and detectors spaced 3cm apart, following the international EEG 10-20 system. \nThe experimental protocol included motor tasks associated with knee extension and \nflexion. Subsequently, the collected data underwent preprocessing using the nirsLAB \ntoolbox to examine hemodynamic responses. A band-pass filter ranging from 0.01 Hz to \n0.3 Hz was applied to eliminate physiological \ninterference.   \n \nResults: Statistical features such as mean, peak, \nskewness, variance, kurtosis and slope were \nextracted from ΔHbO were analyzed. The six \nfeature combination yielded notably higher \nclassification accuracies 9.11% compared to \nother combinations.  The k Nearest Neighbors \nalgorithm stands out with higher accuracy i n \ncontrast quadratic discriminant analysis QDA \n(77.9%) Support vector machine. SVM (75.2%) \nand then Linear discriminate analysis LDA \n(62.2%). The p values, for these comparisons are, than p<0.005. \n \n \nConclusion:  The study proposes a strategy for \nclassifying and utilizing fNIRS data, analyzing six statistical measures as features. Among these, slope emerges as \nsignificant for classification. Combining all six features yields maximum accuracy, followed closely by combinations \nwith fewer features, underscoring their importance. Testing four machine learning classifiers reveals kNN as the most \naccurate, outperforming LDA, QDA, and SVM significantly. The optimal value of k for kNN varies depending on \nsubjects and feature combinations, aiding in performance optimization and overfitting reduction. These findings \nprovide a framework for effectively utilizing fNIRS data in classification tasks, offering insights into feature \nimportance and classifier performance in rehabilitation robotics applications. \n \nReferences: \n[1] N.

One adaptation set and three retention sets of 1h, 24h and 7d were performed. The results \nshow that the activation pattern of the prefrontal cortex during the adapt ation task is maintained \nafter 1h and 24h, but differs after 7d, indicating a possible automatization of the visuomotor map.  \n \nIntroduction:  The rotational visuomotor adaptation task (rVMA) is used to explore how people update their \nvisuomotor map when facing  a mismatch between the movement and the visual feedback . The characteristic early -\nfast and later -slow phases of the behavioral data (initial directional error, IDE) suggest that the solution to the rVMA \nproblem is provided by explicit and implicit processes [1]. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in the explicit processes \ngiven  the contribution of h igh-level cognitive strategies ( i.e., working memory  and response inhibition ) and attention  \nduring rVMA learning  [2]. Furthermore, PFC subareas could be related to  these  distinct functions  during the \nadaptation and retention of the new visuomotor map. The aim of the study was to concurrently examin e and analyze \nthe relation between the behavioral performance and the dorsolateral PFC (DL PFC) and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) \nactivity measured  by functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while learning the rVMA .  \n \nMethods: 22 participants  (21 ± 2 years) performed a n rVMA with -60º of visual -motor mismatch . They were engaged \nin an adaptation set (AD, 312 trials) and three retentions sets at 1 h (RT1), 24 h (RT24), and 7 days (RT7d) (104 trials  \neach). 2D coordinates of a joystick were registered . DLPFC and VLPFC activity of both hemispheres was inferred \nfrom the changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration ([∆O 2Hb])  measured by 16 -channel  fNIRS (Brite MkII, Artinis \nM.S., NL) distributed around F7, F8, F3, F4 locations following EEG 10 -20 International System. Cross -correlation \nanalyses were conducted to  assess the continuous  relationship between rVMA and fNIRS data .  \n \nResults: IDE was positively correlated with the VLPFC areas of both hemispheres at AD1 (R -VLPFC r=0. 6; L-\nVLPFC r=0.8) but only with the R -VLPFC at AD2 (r=0.6). During all retentions, the R -VLPFC and the L -VLPFC \npresented significant and positive correlation with the IDE . On the other hand, during AD1 and AD2 negative \ncorrelations were found between IDE and R -DLPFC (r= -0.8, r=-0.5) and L -DPLFC (r  =-0.9, r =-0.6). The DLPFCs \nalso show ed negative correlations at RT1 and RT24 but not at RT7d.  \n \nConclusion:  During the fast adaptation  (especially AD1)  VLPFCs decrease their activity according to the error \nimprovement , probably because VLPFCs are contributing to the maintenance of the spatial information and to the \nresponse  inhibition  [3]. DLPFC s increased their activity during the transition from fast to slow adaptation phases while \nparticipants decrease d and maintain ed low  errors. DLPFC  could be engage d in processing sensory inputs and planning \nfuture actions  and it happens after the “old” visuomotor map is inhibited [3]. The repetition of this pattern (VLPFCs \ndecrease activity while DLPFC increase) during retention at 1 and 24 h suggests that the “new” visuomotor map is \nless robust and not totally automatized. However, during retention at 7 days only the VLPFCs maintain their significant \n(positive) relationship with the IDE, maybe because the “ne w” visuomotor map is more automatized and individual s \nonly need to inhibit the “old” visuomotor map and update the spatial information.  \n \nReferences  \n[1] Taylor, J.

    "The Development of Cortical Adaptation From Infancy To \nAdulthood \n \nCarmel Moalem, Ofri Levinson, Sagi Jaffe-Dax \n \nSchool of Psychology and Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University \ncarmelmoalem@mail.tau.ac.il \n \nAbstract:  Along development from infancy to adulthood, the brain and cognition undergo changes. \nHowever, the reciprocal relationships between these developmental trajectories remain unknown. \nOne cortical feature that has a well-defined cognitive counterpart is cortical adaptation, which \ncarries implicit perceptual memory. We investigated the development of this feature by measuring \ncortical response to repeated audio-visual stimuli in infants, children, and adults. We hypothesized \nthat adults would exhibit the slowest recovery from adaptation, followed by children and lastly by \ninfants. Indeed, we found different patterns of cortical adaptation along development, which \ncorrespond to the developmental trajectory of implicit memory.  \n \nIntroduction:  Cortical adaptation plays a key role in learning, memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. \nHowever, little is known about how it evolves across different stages of life. The adult and infant brain have been \nshown to respond differently to repeating visual and auditory stimuli1, suggesting differences in cortical adaptation \nthroughout development. However, the exact nature of this difference is poorly understood. Using fNIRS, we \ninvestigated how each lobe in the infant, child, and adult brain responds to repetitions of auditory-visual stimuli with \nvarying inter-stimulus intervals, utilizing cortical adaptation as a proxy for implicit memory dynamics. We \nhypothesize that infants will show faster recovery compared to children and adults, with adults having the slowest \nrecovery time.  \n \nMethods: We measured three groups of participants: 28 Infants aged 10-13 months, 28 Children aged 4.5-5.5 years \nold, and 43 adults aged 19-33 years old. While wearing a fNIRS cap, subjects were shown colorful and engaging \naudio-visual stimuli in six different inter-stimulus intervals (ISI): 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 seconds. Each block of eight \nstimuli had a consistent ISI. We measured cortical response from 42 channels that covered 7 areas of interest (ROIs): \nfrontal left, frontal right, parietal left, parietal right, temporal left, temporal right, and occipital lobes. \n \nResults: We ran a GLM analysis and compared the β scores of infants, \nchildren, and adults’ HbO 2 concentration across all ISI values. We \nfound a significant difference between the age groups in their \nsensitivity to ISI in both temporal lobes (Left: F(2,76) = 5.03, p < 0.01; \nRight: F(2,71)=6.77, p<0.01; Fig. 1). \n \nConclusion:  We found a different pattern of cortical adaptation in each \ngroup, i.e., a different pattern of dependencies between cortical \nresponse and pace of events. This pattern was found across all ROIs, \nsuggesting a larger involvement or influence of cortical adaptation on \nimplicit memory regardless of the stimuli. We will further examine the \nresponse of Hb and HbO 2 throughout the entire block. Since the GLM \nmodel is tailored for adults’ canonical response and does not reveal \nhow cortical response changes through time, an event-related analysis \nmight reveal more differences between the age groups.  \n \nReferences: \n1.

    "The Engagement of Frontoparietal Network in Sequence \nLearning and Sensory Prediction in 8-month-olds and its \nCorrelation with Corresponding Anatomical Development \n \nJingyun Zhu*, Vaidehi Asawa, Kira Burke, Timothy Cheng, Yasmeen Ghaleb, and Lauren \nEmberson \n \nDepartment of Psychology, University of British Columbia, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada  \n*jyzhuu@mail.ubc.ca  \n \nAbstract:  Though sequence learning  and sensory prediction  are regarded as  crucial abilit ies during \ndevelopment, the neural underpinnings lack exploration. The current study with 8 -month -olds aims \nto confirm the stronger functional connectivity of frontoparietal network during learning  and \nsensory prediction , which was previously found in 6 -month -olds (Baek et al., 2022). Besides, the \nsupporting mechanisms for neural development are under debate with the neural -interactionist \nperspective assuming that functional activation helps strengthen  anatomical development. So, the \ncurrent study also aims to test this prediction by exploring the relationship  between task -based and \nresting -state connectivity, expecting to see a positive correlation . \n \nIntroduction:  Sequence learning  and sensory prediction  are critical abilit ies which serve  as the cornerstone of \ndevelopment  and appear  early in life  (e.g., 3 -month -olds in Lewkowicz, 2008) . Considering the relatively immature \nbrain structure and network connectivity in infants, exploring the underlying neural basis in early infancy can help \nwith our understanding of the development and functional capability of responsible networks when compared with \nfindings from adult studies. However, only few studies touched upon this and among which, Baek and colleagues \n(2022) is the first to find an attenuated  brain  responses towards predictable and thus learnable sequences  in 6-month -\nolds, which corresponds to the reduced prediction error in the predictive coding model (Friston, 2005) . A significantly \ngreater functional connectivity in the frontoparietal network during predictable sequences (PS) compared to \nunpredictable sequences (UPS)  was also found , suggesting the involvement of frontoparietal network and its early \nfunctioning at 6 months. For the current study, we plan to  extend this study to  8-month -olds in order  to confirm the \npotential functional role that this  network plays during sequence learnin g and sensory prediction . Moreover, we also \nplan to explore the potential interaction between functional and anatomical brain development, with the latter \nindirectly reflected by the connectivity in resting state. It has been a long -held question of how functional brain \ndevelops and based on neural -interactionist theoretical view, functional engagement of large -scale neural networks \ncan support the development of anatomical structure of these same networks, which in turn serves as the basis for \nfunctional involvement (Johnson, 2011) . The current study can then have a test of this assumption in cross -sectional \n8-month -old data by analyzing the relationship between task -based and resting state connectivity, adding a piece for \nour understanding of the mechanisms supporting brain developmental changes.  \n \nMethods:  Fifty  infants were recruited and wore an fNIRS headgear (NIRx Sport, 48 channels) for both sequence and \nresting session. For the sequence  session, infants were presented with both PS and UPS conditions in a \ncounterbalanced order across participants. Each condition contains 8 sequences,  and each sequence has 2 different \nelements  (smiling shapes with sounds)  being presented in one of four orders ( AAAB, AABA, ABAA,  or BAAA ). \nElem ents are different between conditions. The element order stays the same for PS and is pseudorandom  for UPS. \nFor the analysis, the background functional connectivity approach, which regresses out synchronized task -evoked \nresponses, is applied to examine interactions between regions during learning.  For the resting session, infants were \npresented with a video which is characterized by the constant changes of random shapes and a piece of relaxing music  \n(Vanderwal  et al., 2015 ). The connectivity strength within the frontoparietal network during resting state is calculated \nover a 2 -minute period. Then infants are divided into ‘high’ and ‘low’ groups based on the connectivity  strength during \nsequence  session  and their difference in the resting state connectivity leve l is compared.  \n \nExpected Results: We expect to replicate the effect of greater functional connectivity in the frontoparietal network \nduring sequence session  in 8-month -old infants . We also hypothesize to find a stronger frontoparietal network  \nconnect ivity during resting state in the ‘high’ group compared to ‘low’ group.  172 of 398",
    "Explicitly Interpretable Classification of Functional \nNeuroimaging Data in Neuroergonomics with exFuzzy  \n \nJessica Caterson1, Javier Fumanal Idocin2, Mary Goble1, Ara Darzi1, Felipe Orihuela -\nEspina3, Javier Andreu -Perez*2, Daniel R Leff *1 \n \n1, Imperial College London, U nited Kingdom  2 University of Essex, U nited Kingdom , 3 University of Birmingham, U nited Kingdom  \n*Joint Senior Authors  \nPresenting Author email address: jessica .caterson20@imperial.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Fuzzy logic systems provide a logical approach to analysing functional neuroimaging \ndata. The Python -based ex -fuzzy package is a comprehensive toolbox for creating explicit human -\nreadable fuzzy rule -based logic systems for data classification. It includes functions for generating \nAI-based explanations from summary and time -based fNIRS recording  data. This study uses data \nfrom research on the neuroergonomics of cognitive load in surgeons to show how exFuzzy can be \nused for analytical tasks, producing accurate , interpretable explanations of neural activation.   \n \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable tool in the discipline of neuroergonomics \nfor measur ing neural activation related to cognitive load due to its non -invasiveness , portability, and good temporal \nand spatial resolution.  Machine learning classifiers often used for this data  (e.g. SVMs, Neural Networks) struggle to \neffectively identify  complex, multi -variate  pattern  characteristics without compromising  interpretability . Fuzzy logic \nsystems are a proposed method for the analysis of fNIRS signals, overcoming these limitations  by permitting multi -\nvariate analysis with readable  results in a semantic form  easily interpretable by humans [1]. The python -based exFuzzy  \npackage enables AI -based analysis of fNIRS data to produce  explanations from time -based and summary data [ 2]. \nThe aim of this study was to explore the use of fuzzy logic systems using fNIRS for the classification  and interpretation \nof neural activation in surgeons  under different cognitive loads  using exFuzzy .  \n \nMethods: Twenty novice surgeons complete d five trials of a simple suturing task  under  (1) self -paced (SP), (2) time -\npressured (TP), and (3) time-pressured with extraneous cognitive load (all stress, AS)  conditions (total 300 trials) . \nfNIRS signals were measured using  a NIRSports 2 device (NIRX)  in the prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and \nsupplementary motor areas . Oxygenated hemoglobin  (HbO 2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin  (HHb ) signals were \nprocessed with a first-pass filter (including  decimation, detrending, optode movement detection, removal of systemic \nand automated quality control) , and summary statistics  were generated  (mean task minus mean baseline signal, task \narea under the curve, task time to peak, task time to nadir) using ICNNA software  [3]. The Python -based ex -fuzzy \npackage was used to create readable fuzzy rule -based logic systems for the classification  of each cognitive state.  Rules \nwere generated  from both summary and time -based data from fNIRS recordings  in a readable format . Performance \nwas assessed  by comparing model classification with  the true experimental condition.    \n \nResults: The exFuzzy package successfully generated fuzzy rule -based logic systems that effectively identified \ndifferences in channel activation patterns across the NP, TP, and AS conditions, achieving a satisfactory performance . \nFeature selection  improved  classification performance.  The models generated interpretable  and explicit  'IF... THEN...' \nlogic premises, where a functional antecedent leads to a consequent state, associated with neuroanatomical functions \ndetected by fNIRS in specific cognitive states.  The integration of multiple channels within single rules suggested \npotential insightful connective pathways that relate neural activation to differentiate between  cognitive states.   \n \nConclusion:  Our study highlights the advantages of using fuzzy rule -based logic systems to classify fNIRS signals, \naiding in the analysis and interpretation of neural activation in surgeons under varying cognitive loads. These results \ncontribute to understanding the neurophysiology of different cognitive states and their link to surgical performance , \nwhich is essential for patient safety . The  explicit  transparency of the classification model enhances trust,  supports \nmodel debugging and validation , and facilitates communication with non -technical stakeholders and regulatory \ncompliance, which are essential components for  the integrat ion of  these systems in the operating room.  \n \nReferences . \n1.

    "Predicting Second Language Proficiency Using fNIRS Data \nduring Word Translation  \n \nW. Kawaia, K. Niiokaa,b, K. Shinozukaa, and I.Dana \n \na.Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan ,   \nbDepartment of Crime and Psychology, Th e University of Human Environments, Ehime , Japan  \nPresenting Author email address: a18.ffnn@g.chuo -u.ac.jp  \n \nAbstract:  The current study aimed to develop an interpretable machine -learning model to predict \nindividual listening, reading, and overall  second language  proficienc y by utilizing the degree of \nactivation during word translation as features . The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator \n(LASSO ) was employed  as the model . We achieved a moderate correlation (r =0.52) between \npredicted and true scores for overall second language proficiency . Given that activation in the \nWernicke ’s area contributed to predicting all kinds of scores, this region appears to be the most \nimportant for predicting second language proficiency.  \n \nIntroduction:  Word translation is an integrated process involving phonological, lexical, and orthographic knowledge1. \nPrevious  research has demonstrated the predictability of second language listening proficiency utilizing EEG data \nwhile participants listened to dialogues of a test2. However, to our knowledge, no study has attempted to predict second \nlanguage proficiency using cortical activation data obtained from tasks involving multiple language processes. Our \nstudy aimed to develop an interpretable machine -learning model to predict individual scores for listening, reading, \nand overall  second language proficienc y. We also sought to explore different  features used in constructing each model.  \n \nMethods: We utilized data from 88 English learners of Japanese, partly obtained from a previous study3. Each \nlistening, reading, and total TOEI C® scores were used as the measure of  second language proficiency. Participants \nperformed the word translation task with four task conditions (2 translation directions and high/low word familiarity ) \nwhile their cortical activation was measured using a fNIRS device, ETG -4000 (Hitachi, Japan) with 52  channels. Data \nwere preprocessed to remove noise, and −values , representing  the degree  of activation , were derived from the general \nlinear model (GLM) analysis. We used these 416 -values (4 task conditions x 52 channels x 2 hemoglobin types \n(oxy/deoxy )) as features in the subsequent model building . To select optimum parameters and reduce the \ndimensionality of the data, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used as the model. We \nused leave -one-out cross -validation (LOOCV) to prevent  overfitting. The optimal hyperparameter,  (the penalty \nterm), was searched between 0.1 to 3.0 in increments of 0.1 using 10 -fold \nvalidation for each training data set in LOOCV. The mean absolute error (MAE) \nand Pearson’s r between the predicted and true scores were u tilized  to evaluate  the \nmodel. Additionally, the number of times each feature was selected was counted \nto consider which feature contributed to the construction of the model.  \n \nResults: The MAE, Pearson ’s r, and the number of features selected for maximum \nfrequency to predict each score were as follo ws: for listening  scores,  MAE = \n176±130, r = 0.52, 11, for reading  scores,  MAE = 87±61, r = 0.31, 6, and for total \nscores,  MAE = 176±130, r = 0.52 , 16 (Fig 1) . The oxy -Hb of Wernicke’s area for \ntranslating Japanese low -familiarity words into English was the only common \nfeature consistently selected across all models a t maximum frequency (Fig 2) . \n \nConclusion:  We were able to build a model predicting second \nlanguage proficiency scores.  The importance of the Wernicke ’s area \nin predicting second language proficiency is further supported by a  \nprevious study reporting activation differences in t he Wernicke ’s \narea between advanced and elementary learners3.   \n \nReferences:   \n1.

Among  the 20 boys  and 40 girls  (13-15yrs old ), no differences were \nseen between conditions for WM, but o xygenated -haemoglobin  increased  in the right prefrontal \ncortex  after a high -nitrate breakfast during the 3 -back  (β 0.05, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.07) \nbut decreased after regular breakfast , which were different from no breakfast . Thus, different \nneurophysiological mechanisms may be at play depending  on breakfast composition.  \n \nIntroduction:  Dietary nitrate has been suggested to acutely improve working memory (WM) among older adults1 by \nincreas ing cerebral blood flow .2, 3 However, these effects  have not been investigated among  adolescents . Breakfast \nhas also been correlated with many beneficial health outcomes;  yet, breakfast skipping is around 29% among European \nadolescents.4 Reported effects of breakfast on cognitive performance have been mixed ,5 and the mechanisms \nunknown. Therefore, in this study we assess ed the acute effects of having no breakfast  compared to  a high -nitrate \nbreakfast (regular breakfast with concentrated beetroot juice) or regular breakfast on WM and cognitive task -related \nhaemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex  in adolescents . \n \nMethods: A within -person , 3-arm randomised, crossover, pre test-posttest comparison study design was used. \nAdolescents (age 13-15yrs old)  were recruited (n=60 ; 40 girls ) from schools in Stockholm.  Tests  were performed \nbefore each breakfast condition and about 130  min after, includ ing: numerical computerised 1 -, 2-, 3-back tests  to \nassess WM (reaction time and accuracy ), and c ognitive -task related changes in the  cortical haemodynamic response  \n(oxygenated [oxy -Hb]- and deoxygenated -haemoglobin [deoxy -Hb]) captured using  functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRSport  8x8 system with 8 short -separation channels ), simultaneously  as the n -back tests.  \n \nResults: There were no significant differences in the improvements in reaction time or accuracy between the breakfast \nconditions. In the high -nitrate breakfast there were significant increases in oxy -Hb in the right prefrontal cortex during \nthe 3 -back ( β 0.05 ( 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.07)) and decreases in deoxy -Hb in the left and right prefrontal  \ncortex . There were significant decreases in oxy -Hb and incre ases in deoxy -Hb during the regular breakfast  condition  \nin the 2 -back and 3 -back across the  prefrontal cortex.  Between conditions, there were s ignificant decreases in oxy -Hb \nin regular breakfast compared to the no breakfast condition in the 3 -back but increases in deoxy -Hb. Comparing the \nno breakfast to the high-nitrate breakfast there were significant increases in oxy -Hb in the 2 -back and the 3 -back tests, \nbut de creases in de oxy-Hb. \n \nConclusion:  Supplementation of nitrate or having breakfast compared to no breakfast showed no difference in WM \nperformance in adolescents  and preserved acute WM performance . However, the vascular mechanisms differed by \nbreakfast composition. Therefore, nitrate may induce beneficial cerebrovascular effects, whereas having breakfast \nmay lead to neural efficiency compared to not having breakfast. Further studies are needed to verify these results . \n \nReferences :  1.Wightman EL, et al. Physiol Behav. 2015.  2.Bond V, Jr., et al. Cardiol Res Pract. 2013.  3.Presley \nTD, et al.

Significant oxygenated hemoglobin  (oxy-Hb) changes \nwere observed in several regions for both states, with the right temporo -parietal region showing \npronounced activation in response to normal speech. Our findings confirm its crucial role in pitch \nprocessing and highlight state -dependent functional  variations in the frontal and occipital regions.  \n \nIntroduction:  Infants demonstrate sensitivity to the speech sounds in their environment. Even while asleep, they seem \nto register the voices of people nearby. Prior research has shown that infant brains ar e attuned to these sounds, and \ntheir neural responses vary depending on whether they are awake or asleep (e.g., Taga et al., 2018). Compared to their \nawake counterparts, sleeping infants display broader cortical activations across multiple regions. This st udy \ninvestigates whether the cortical processing of speech prosody remains consistent between wakefulness and sleep.  \n \nMethods: Data from awake and quietly sleeping 3 -month -old infants were analyzed in this study (N = 50 and 26, \nrespectively). Auditory sent ences, either normal or flattened speech, were presented to them while cortical activation \nwas measured using a 94 -channel fNIRS system (ETG -7000, Hitachi). Changes in hemoglobin signals were assessed \nby averaging over segmented data blocks, following the rejection of blocks contaminated by artifacts.  \n \nResults: Quietly sleeping infants exhibited changes in oxy -Hb signals  across most regions in response to both normal \nand flattened speech sounds. These changes were particularly notable in the temporal regions, with similar magnitudes \nbetween speech types. Additionally, the right temporo -parietal region displayed larger oxy -Hb changes for normal \nspeech compared to flattened speech (Fig. 1). Awake infants also showed differences in this region. While speech \nsounds decreased oxy -Hb signals in the frontal and occipital regions, they increased in the temporal regions.  \n \nConclusio n: This study replicates our previous finding in the right temporo -parietal region of sleeping infants (Homae \net al., 2006).  The present result confirms that this region is activated by normal speech sounds including pitch changes \nin awake infants, demons trating its crucial role in pitch processing across different states. Furthermore, variations in \nthe frontal and occipital regions highlight their unique roles, reflecting the brain's functional differentiation and \nunderscoring the importance of neural mec hanisms adaptable to changing states.  \n \nReferences :  \nHomae, F. et al.

    "A high-density multifactorial study of infants' social \ncognition  \n \nZ. Soleimani, K. Kolivand, J.K. Hamlin, L.L. Emberson  \nDepartment of Psychology, University of British Columbia,2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada  \nPresenting Author email address: zrsoleimani@gmail.com  \n \nAbstract: While adult studies suggest that social processes are supported by a specialized \"social \nbrain network”, it remains unclear to what extent this network is already active in infancy . The \ncurrent study aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms that infants use to understand social \nevents. Thirty -four 6 -month -old infants’ neural responses to human and non -human social events \nhave been measured using high -density fNIRS recordings with full -head coverage. The resul ts will \nallow us to develop a localizer for social cognitive processing in infancy and may shed light on the \nmechanisms underlying infants’ processing of different kinds of social agents and interactions.  \n \nIntroduction:  Neuroimaging studies in adults suggest that social processes are supported by a highly specialized \n\"social brain network” (e.g., Isik et al, 2017; Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003; Walbrin et al, 2018). This network produces \nactivity that, for instance, distinguishe s agents from non -agents, intentional acts from non -intentional ones, individual \naction from interaction, and even positive from negative sociomoral valence. However, it remains unclear to what \nextent this network is already active in infancy and how it de velops. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the \nsocial brain network from early in development utilizing stimuli that expand and improve upon established stimuli \nfrom the infancy literature. In particular, whereas existing stimulus sets often include significant perceptual differences \nbetween social conditions and non -social baselines  (e.g., non -matched humans vs. toys actions; Lloyd - Fox et al., \n2009) , our stimuli include matched human actions and object movements. Second, whereas many key features of the \nsocial world  – for instance, human versus nonhuman agents, first - versus third -person interactions, and positive versus \nnegative social interactions – have yet to be examined within existing stimuli sets, our stimuli allow us to \nsystematically examine how activity in s ocial brain regions is similar or different across these distinct social contexts.   \nMethods:  Our target is to obtain a final dataset of 34 6 -month -old infants’ brain responses through high -density fNIRS \nrecordings using the LUMO system (Gowerlabs) with full head coverage. To date 80 infants have been tested in order \nto maximize our likelihood of reaching our sample size goal after attrition, (we anticipate a higher -than-usual attrition \nrate due to observed poor signal quality from the LUMO system in infants with dense/dark hair). Infants viewed a \nmaximum of 32 videos in a within -subject event desi gn; 16 videos represented social events and 16 represented \nmatched non -social control events (active baseline). Within the 16 events in the social condition, eight involved human \nagents (including actors from two racial groups: Caucasian and East Asian ), and  eight involved non -human animated \nagents. Social events also differed in terms of their valence (8 positive, 8 negative). Events involving human agents \ndiffered by interaction type (4 first –person, 4 third -person interactions) and events involving nonhuman animated \nagents differed by point of view (4 straight -on, 4 birds’ -eye). All events are approximately 10 seconds long; each \nsocial event is immediately preceded by its matched 10 -second active baseline.   \nResults: Preliminary analyses will be completed by the conference. We expect that the social brain regions, \nestablished in adults and previous studies with infants, will show higher activation in response to human agents than \nnon-agentic controls. This would estab lish that, even with more rigorously controlled stimuli, infants engage similar \nbrain regions during social observations as do adults. We will then determine how many trials are sufficient to robustly \nobserve this effect, to determine whether these stimuli  can be used as a localizer added onto other tasks. As exploratory \nhypotheses, we also predict that infants’ social brain regions will be activated while observing interactive nonhuman \nagents relative to non -agentic controls, and will explore whether the same neural response is observed to human versus \nnonhuman agents. Finally, if we have sufficient trials,  we will examine neural responses to positive vs. negative social \nstimuli, first - versus third -party interactions, and distinct points of view.   \nConclusion:  The main goal for this study is to further our understanding of the neural systems used by infants during \nsocial cognition using better controlled and more broadly defined social stimuli. We hope to determine the minimum \nnumber of trials necessary to produce a robust result, and to release these stimuli and data to help the field create a \nlocalizer for social cognitive regions for use in future studies. In addition, the findings from the study will shed light \non the mechanisms underlying infants’ social understanding of  human vs non -human agents, third -person vs first -\nperson interactions, and positive vs negative social events.  177 of 398",
    "Neural coupling in parents in association with ASD traits \nand subjective behavioural ratings  \n \nLaura Mtewele1, Anil Karabulut1,2 , Ricky Chmitorz1 , Ben Marlow3, Pascal Vrticka1  \n1Centre for Brain Science, Department of Psychology, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom  \n2Social and Affective Neuroscience Group, MoMiLab, IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy  \n3Colchester Hospital, East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Colchester, United Kingdom  \n \nLaura Mtewele, University of Essex ,  \nLm22433@essex.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) entails social and communication challenges. Research \nlinks these difficulties to reduced Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathy. Differences in brain -to-brain \ncoupling or neural coherence resulting from exposure to shared external stimuli may explain some \nof the challenges associated with ASD. To investigate this, cohabiting parents will engage in a \nconflict discussion and provide c ontinuous subjective affective ratings of the self and their partner \nbased on the discussions’ video -recording. Simultaneously, parents’ brain activity will be recorded \nusing fNIRS hyperscanning. We are interested in how ASD, ToM, and empathy traits relate  to \ncoupling and affective ratings.  \n \nIntroduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by impairments in social interaction and \ncommunication across multiple contexts. Past research suggests that this deficit is mediated by a diminished ability to \nattribute mental states to the self and others (ToM), as well as challenges in sharing and understanding others’ emotions \n(empathy). Coupling, the entrainment of two individuals’ neural activity in response to shared external stimuli, may \npartially explain individual differences in the ca pacity for ToM and empathy, and some evidence suggests that \nindividuals with ASD show diminished or atypical coupling during joint video viewing with others. However, there \nis a paucity of research on how ASD, ToM, and empathy traits relate to brain -to-brain coupling. ToM and empathy \nare especially relevant during social interactions, including conflict, which require the accurate representation and \nprediction of one’s own and the interaction partner’s mental states. Within such a setting, increased couplin g is also \nthought to reflect relationship closeness and quality, potentially facilitating improved communication during conflict.  \n \nMethods: To fill this gap, co -habiting parents of 4 -8-year old children (N=60 dyads) will engage in a video -recorded \nconflict discussion about a common relationship issue. Subsequently, parents will view a video -recording of the \ndiscussion while their brain activit y is recorded using fNIRS hyperscanning. Neural coherence will then be derived \nfrom the dorsolateral -prefrontal -cortex (DLPFC) and temporo -parietal junction (TPJ) by means of Wavelet Transform \nCoherence (WTC) analysis. Each parent will also provid e continuous subjective affective ratings of their own and \ntheir partners’ emotional state while viewing the discussion video -recording. In addition, video -coding by two \nindependent raters will provide a behavioural measure of alignment between the couple during the discussion. Finally, \nASD, ToM and empathy traits will be assessed by self -report questionnaires.   \n \nResults: We expect that ASD traits will negatively correlate with neural coupling during video -viewing, which will \nalso reflect in less accurate subjective ratings of the self and the partner’s emotional state as well as decreased \nbehavioural alignment during the discussion. In contrast, we expect that  ToM and empathy traits will be positively \nassociated with neural coupling, behavioural synchrony, but negatively with ASD traits. Although data collection has \nnot commenced yet, preliminary results will be a vailable by September.  \n \nConclusion: The current research aims to better understand not only the underlying functional neural correlates of \nneural coupling during re -exposure to conflict, but investigate how they relate to individual differences in ASD, ToM, \nand empathy traits as well as beha vioural alignment.  \n \n \n \n178 of 398",

The participants \ndemonstrated diverse task performances in the digital upper limb  (UL) rehabilitation program  and \ndistinct cortical activation patterns that varied with different motor function levels in the diverse \ncortical areas such as  ipsilesional  primary motor area , primary somatosen sory area, and contr alateral  \nprefrontal cortices . The integration of task performance scores with fNIRS data significantly \nimproved classification accuracy of motor impairment severity  while  using  the K -NN algorithm . \nThese findings support developing personalized digital rehabilitation strategies  and underscoring \nthe need for further research.  \n \nIntroduction:  Stroke causes long -term disabilities and underlines the need for innovative rehabilitation strategies to \nreduce residual impairments. This study aimed to assess cortical activation patterns in patients with chronic stroke \nduring digital upper limb  (UL)  rehabilitation  using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) . \n \nMethods: This cross -sectional study included 18 patients with chronic stroke (13 men aged 67.0 ± 7.1 years). Motor \nfunction was evaluated using various tests, including the Fugl –Meyer assessment for the upper extremity (FMA -UE), \ngrip and tip pinch strength test, and box and block test. All participants completed the digital UL rehabilitation program \nusing MotoCog® (Cybermedic Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea) while being monitored with whole bra in fNIRS using 84 \nchanne ls of NIRScout® (NIRx Inc., Germany). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze the cortical \nactivation patterns from the fNIRS data. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to investigate the correlations \namong motor function scores and oxy -Hb t-values . A p-value of 0.05 was used for all analyses. The K -nearest neighbor \n(K-NN) algorithm was utilized to classify the severity of motor impairment of stroke  patients  using task performance \nscores and hemodynamic responses measured by fNIRS data . \n \nResults: The p articipants demonstrated diverse task performances in the digital UL rehabilitation program, showing \ndistinct patterns of cortical activation that varied with different motor function levels. Significant activation was \nobserved in the ipsilesional primary motor area (M1), primary somatosensory area (S1), and contralateral prefrontal \ncortex (PFC) during the UL rehabilitation program. Furthermore, a positive correlation between FMA -UE scores and \nSPM t -values was observed in the ipsilesional M1, whereas negative correlations were observed in the ipsilesional S1. \nIncorporating cortical hemodynamic responses (oxy -Hb t-values) with task per formance scores during the  digital UL \nrehabilitation program markedly improved the accuracy of cl assifying  UL functional levels in stroke patients to  83.3% \nby the K -NN algorithm  compared to 44.4% while using task score only . In a subgroup analysis, participants with \nrelatively lower upper limb function (FMA -UE: 32 –47 points) showed activation  of widespread brain areas such as \nthe bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMAs), bilateral posterior parietal cortices (PPC), and bilateral PFC  than \nthose of participants with higher UL function (FMA -UE: 48 –64 points) . \n \nConclusion:  The results advocated the development of tailored digital UL rehabilitation strategies by combining \nbehavioral and cerebral hemodynamic data of patients with stroke , therefore, may help to establish  paradigm s of \npersonalized UL rehabilitation for stroke recovery , nevertheless, f urther research es should be invited to verify  these \nresults .  \n \nAcknowledgement  \nThis work was supported by the Korea Medical Device Development Fund grant funded by the Korean government (Ministry of Science and ICT , \nMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Ministry of Health & Welfare, and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety) (KMDF ‑RS‑2022 –0014047 8). 179 of 398",
    "Interactive Multi -Touch Games Enhance Prefrontal and \nCognitive Flexibility Related Network Activities  and Inter-\nBrain Synchrony in the Elderly  \n \nJinuk Kim1, Eunmi Kim2, Su-Hyun Lee2, Yun-Hee Kim2,3 \n \n1 Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Suwon, Republic of Korea  \n2 Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea  \n3 Myongji Choonhey Rehabilitation Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea   \nPresenting Author email address: kimjuk92@gmail.com  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigated effects of interactive multi -touch game -based cognitive  \ninterventions (ICI) on enhancing prefrontal and cognitive flexibility  related  network  activities  in the \nelderly. This randomized  controlled trial with 32 elderly participants revealed significant post -\nintervention improvements in the ICI group in cognitive flexibility  measured by the Stroop test as \nwell as , prefrontal activation, and network connectivity  analyzed  by functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy data compared to the traditional cognitive intervention (TCI) group . Furthermore, \nhyperscanning analysis during the intervention showed that ICI significantly boosted both intra - and \ninter-brain synchrony, but not in the TCI group . These results highlight ed the possibility  of \ncollaborative digital games as a novel strategy for cognitive intervention in  the elderly.  \n \nIntroduction:  Interactive multi -touch game -based cognitive interventions present a promising avenue for enhancing \ncognitive performance among the elderly . This study explores the impact of interactive multi -touch games on \nprefrontal activation, network changes related to cognitive flexibility, and inter -brain synchrony among the elderly.  \n \nMethods: Thirty -two elderly participants (13 males; mean age 74.5 ± 4.3) participated in a single -blind, randomized, \ncontrolled trial, divided into an interactive multi -touch game -based cognitive intervention (ICI) group and a traditional \ncognitive intervention (TCI) group. Over four weeks, both groups engaged in twelve 4 0-minute cognitive training \nsessions. The ICI group partook in gamified tasks on a multi -touch screen designed for collaborative play across key \ncognitive domains  using HAPPYTABLE® (Spring Soft Co. Ltd, Seoul, Republic of Korea) , whereas the TCI group \nengaged in traditional paper -and-pencil tasks. We assessed changes in cognitive flexibility -related prefrontal activity \nand network changes using a 20  channel s of functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system (NIRScout ®, NIRx \nMedical Technologies, Germany). Measurements were taken during the color -word Stroop task  (CWST)  both before \nand after the intervention. Inter -brain synchrony was evaluated through hyperscanning techniques during the \nintervention, utilizing the same 20 -channel topographic map across participants.  Analysis involved using correlation \nanalysis methods to assess intra -brain network synchrony within the prefrontal cortex and inter -brain synchrony \namong participants . The Wilcoxon signed -rank test and Mann -Whitney U test were applied to determine statistical \nsignificance, set at a p-value of 0.05.  \n \nResults: After 10 intervention sessions, the ICI group showed significant improvement  in interference scores and \ninterference ratios of Stroop test  compared  to TCI group . Significant differences were noted in oxyHb concentration \nduring Stroop interference at the prefrontal  cortex  between the ICI and TCI groups. In the ICI group, oxyHb \nconcentration increased in these areas at post-intervention, whereas they decreased in the TCI group.  Connectivity \nwithin the prefrontal cortex significantly enhanced in the ICI group after 10 intervention sessions . While some \nconnections in the TCI group showed significant increases, others were reported to decrease.  During the intervention, \nintra-brain synchrony within the prefrontal cortex was stronger in the ICI group compared to the TCI group.  \nRemarkably, i nter-brain synchrony, reflecting connectivity between participants, was significantly stronger in the ICI \ngroup than in the TCI group, especially between the dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex  and orbitofrontal cortex  of two \nsubjects . \n \nConclusion:  Interactive multi -touch game -based interventions effectively enhance cognitive flexibility ,  prefrontal \nactiv ity, network connectivity , and inter -brain synchrony among the elderly. These findings may advocate for \nincorporating collaborative digital games into cognitive training programs as a viable strategy for modulating  age-\nrelated cognitive decline.  \n \nAcknowledgement  \nThis work was supported by the Korea Medical Device Development Fund grant funded by the Korean government (Ministry of Science and ICT, \nMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Ministry of Health & Welfare, and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety) (KMDF ‑RS‑2022 –00140478).  180 of 398",
    "The Prometeus project : Nutrition al strategies to target \npremature brain health  \n \nPrometeus Consortium  \n \nMultiple affiliations  \nPresenting Author email address: Sabrina Brigadoi ( sabrina .brigadoi@unipd.it ) on behalf of the Prometeus Consortium  \n \nAbstract:  Current nutritional strategies for preterm neonates are based on non -personalized \nnutritional charts  and do not take in to consideration the brain status . Provision of adequate nutrients \nand oxygen is , however,  essential for proper brain  growth and development. Prometeus will develop \na ground -breaking technology aiming at individualizing nutritional intakes  targeting brain health. \nThis will be achieved by developing the neonatal clinical a dvisor, a controller based on a metabolic \nmodel that will provide individual nutri tional strategies, based on the i nputs of a minimally invasive \nmetabolic sensor and a non-invasive  optical cap measuring  brain  oxygen saturation and perfusion.  \n \nIntroduction:  The number of former preterm infants showing neurodevelopmental impairments is increasing due to \nan increase  in the ir survival rate . After preterm birth, the provision of key metabolites  occurs with parenteral nutrition , \nand is not filtered anymore by the placenta . Therefore, transie nt sh ortage of these key metabolites  or oxygen, in the \nabsence of a neonatal adjus tment based on neonatal feedback , could impact brain development  and increase the risk \nof future impairments.  Currently, no tools are available  to continuously monitor at the co t-side multi -regional brain \nhealth and metabolic  fuels.  Current nutritional  strategie s (parenteral provision of glucose, proteins and l ipids) , \ntherefore, are unable to target  brain health.  Here, we present Prometeus , an EU -funded project, aiming to develop a \nneonatal clinical advisor (NCA) , whi ch will guide parenteral nutritional intakes to achieve optimal brain oxygenation.   \nMethods: Prome teus project is divided into 6 objective s (see Fig . 1). The first one involves the developmental of neo -\noptical, an optical imaging device with four modules incorporating time -domain NIRS  and speckle contrast optical \nspectroscopy , which will  be positioned  in four different head locations. The modules will be hosted in an ergonomic \ncap developed to fit the pr emature  head and be use d in clinical settings . The second objective involves the development \nof a continuous metabolic monitoring (CMM) device, a minimally invasive device able to continuously measure \nglucose, lactate and beta - hydroxybutyrate , the key metabolic fuels. The third objective  involves  the development of \nthe metabolic m odel, which will define the relation \nbetween  different nutritional strate gies, brain \nhemodynamics (StO 2, CBF and CMRO 2) and \nmetabolisms . To achieve  this, an in -animal study will be \nperformed using Sprague Dawley rat s, which wi ll be fed \nusing different diets an d will be subject to metabolic \nchallenges (e.g., hypo or hyperglycemic clamps)  while \nbeing monitored wit h MRI and optical imagin g. These \ndata will be used to develop the neonatal in-silico  avatar  \nand the NCA, which will provide nutritional strategies \nbased on the i nputs from n eo-opticap and CMM. The \nfourth objective involves the creation of the digital twin \nof the premature baby, a cloud -based app with a double \ninterface. One, for the health -care personnel, providing \nthe output s of the NCA  and alerts from the Prometeus  \ndevices, and the other f or parents , providing adapt ed information to families on the well -being of their baby . The fifth \nobjective aims to test the Prometeus device for the first time in premature babies, while the sixth objectives  (our social \nstudy)  aims to take the human factor into consideratio n while developing  on-body monitoring devices, with the final \naim to develop the first oral and visual archive of prematur ity, documenting perception and impact of prematurity and \non-body moni toring devices on both healthcare  personnel and families experiencing  preterm births.   \nResults: The project started one yea r ago and several pro gresses have been made to reach each of these objectives.  \nUpdates are posted on the project website: https://www.prometeus -eic.eu/  \nConclusion:  If successful, Prometeus will reduce the num ber of preterm infants developing impairment s in life.  \nAcknowledgments: This work is supported by the E uropean Innovation Council  under grant 101099093 .

    "An infant within-subject multimodal NIRS-EEG classifier \n \nJessica Gemignani1,2 and Judit Gervain1,2,3 \n \n1 Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padua, Via Venezia 8 , 35131 Padova  (PD), Italy  \n2 Padova Neuroscience  Center (PNC), Padova (PD), Italy  \n3 Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center, Université Paris Cité  & CNRS, Paris, France  \n \nPresenting Author email address: jessica.gemignani@unipd.it  \n \nAbstract:  In this work we present a within -subject multivariate pattern analysis using concurrent \nfNIRS and EEG measures to discriminate patterns elicited by different auditory conditions in \nnewborns.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS ) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two of the most \npopular neuroimaging methods in the developmental neurosciences. They offer very different, yet complementary \nstrengths, so their combination is highly desirable to  gain a fuller understanding of cognitive processes of interest. In \nthis work, we investigate the feasibility of employing them together, in a multivariate & multimodal pattern analysis \nfashion, to investigate neuro -functional mechanisms of processing of prosody at birth.  \n \nMethods: Two full-term newborns were tested with concurrent NIRS -EEG  at the maternity ward of the hospital of \nPadua , while being presented with two auditory conditions: (i) sp oken  sentences  in Italian  (“Speech ”); (ii) baboon \nvocalizations  (“Vocalization s”), using a montage including 16 NIRS channels, distributed bilaterally  on the temporal \nand temporo -parietal areas , and 6 EEG electrodes  (F3-Fz-F4-C3-Cz-C4), similarly to [1]  .For each condition, 5 blocks \nwere presented  (mean  duration of  65 s; inter -block interval 2 0-30s), each contain ing 25 repetitions of the same \nsentence or vocalization ; fNIRS data was pre -processed by performing  motion artifact correction with the temporal \nderivative distribution repair  (TDDR) algorithm, bandpass frequency filtering (0.01 -0.7 Hz) and rejection of trials \naffected by residual motion artifacts.  EEG data was pre -processed  with bandpass frequency filtering (1 -40 Hz), motion \nartifact correction with the artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) algorithm and rejection of trials affected by residual \nmotion artifacts. NIRS features were  extracted for each block  in each channel from HbO and HbR, separately , as the \naverage of the response within a 85s time -window starting at the onse t, yielding a total dimension of 16 features x 10 \ntrials, for HbO and HbR independently. An additional NIRS matrix was also created, with both HbO and HbR features, \nwith dimension 32 x 10.  EEG features were extracted for each epoch in  each electrode in 4 time windows  of interest  \n(50-150, 150 -250, 250 -350, 550 -650 ms). Then, they were averaged within their corresponding NIRS block , thus \nyielding an EEG feature matrix of 24 x 10.  A multivariate pattern matrix was built by merging the NIRS and EEG \nmatrices, along the feature dimension . Feature vectors were normalized , and c lassification of Speech vs Vocalization \ntrials was performed with linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the toolbox introduced by [2], available \nonline , using 4 -folds cross validation. Statistical significance was assessed using permutation tests (N=1000).  \n \nResults: For Baby 1, the classifier achieved significant accuracies when using HbO ( 81.7% , p < 0.05 ), and when using \nEEG+HbO+HbR, with a larger accuracy in the latter case ( 85.25%, p < 0.05). For Baby 2, accuracies were smaller and \nnon significant, but the largest was that obtained on EEG+HbO+HbR (58.5%).  \n \nConclusions: Future work will investigate \ninter-subject variability in classification \naccuracies , but preliminary results suggest \nthat using EEG features and features \ncombined from both hemoglobin \ncomponents contributes to enhanced \nperformances.  \n \nReferences:  \n1.Cabrera and Gervain (2020), Science \nAdvances  \n2.Ashton, K.  et al.

However, the processing of songs might be particularly relevant  to investigate as it \nrequires the ability to process musical and linguistic information simultaneously. The current work \nexplores this compelling question by measuring newborns’ responses to speech, song and hummed \nsentences, with fNIRS.   \n \nIntroduction:  For humans, speech and music represent the most abstract, structured, and therefore cognitively  \ncomplex, use of sounds. Processing both speech and music requires perceiving and integrating their  distinctive, \nalthough in some respects similar, acoustic dimensions1. Several  studies in the literature have extensively explored \nsimilarities and differences in how the adult brain  perceives music and speec h2. By contrast, little is known  about \nwhether infants, and especially newborns, process these two types of auditory stimuli  similarly.  Existing studies \nsuggest that the newborn brain is already lateralized for the prenatally heard  language3,4, activating the left auditory \ncortex, as well as for  instrumental music, activating the right auditory corte x5,6. However,  there is little evidence about \nthe neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the perception of song at  birth. In this work, we therefore explore how the \nnewborn brain processes speech, sung and  hummed melodies at birth , using fNIRS.  \n \nMethods: Newborns (0 -5 days of age) were tested with fNIRS at the maternity ward of the hospital of Padua , while \nbeing presented with three auditory conditions: (i) sp oken  sentences  in Italian  (“Speech ”); (ii) Italian sung sentences \n(“Song ”); and (iii) Hummed song melody  (“Hummed ”). For each condition, 6 blocks were presented , each having an \naverage duration of 15 s; inter -block interval was jittered between 25 and 30s, resulting in a total study duration of \nabout 13 minutes . fNIRS data was pre -processed using a standard pre -processing routine that included bandpass \nfrequency filtering (0.01 -0.7 Hz) and rejection of trials affected by motion artifacts7. A 20 -channels configuration (10 \nper hemisphere; 8 sources and 8 detectors) probing the frontal, parietal and temporal areas was used (i.e., frontal lobe: \nchannels 1, 2, 4, 5 (LH) and 13, 14, 15, 16 (RH) ; temporal lobe: channels 3, 6 (LH) and 17, 19 (RH); parietal lobe: \nchannels 7, 10, 12 (LH) and 18, 20, 23 (RH); finally, tempo ro-parietal lobes : channels 11 (LH) and 21 (RH).  \n \nResults: Data acquisition is still ongoing; Figure 1 shows preliminary grand -averages currently including data from \nN=35 newborns.  Qualitatively, areas \nknown to be involved with speech \nprocessing, like the left temporal area \n(channels 3, 6) display also large \nactivations to the Song condition. \nThe statistical analysis, carried out \nusing cluster -based permutation \ntests, will shed light on the \ndifferential patterns of activations; \nespecially, it will be relevant to \ncompare those elicited by Speech and  \nSong, i.e., sharing linguistic \ninformation, and those elicited by \nSong and Hummed  melody , i.e., \nsharing melodic information.

    "Cortical correlates of Hand Blink Reflex : insight from  Near-\nInfrared Spectroscopy  study \n \nMonica Biggio1, Costanza Iester1, Ambra Bisio2, Sabrina Brigadoi3, Simone Cutini3, Laura \nBonzano1-4, Marco Bove2-4 \n \n1Department of Neuroscience, DINOGMI, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy  \n2DIMES, Section of Human Physiology, University of Genoa, Genova, Liguria, Italy  \n3Department of Developmental Psychology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy  \n4IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy ,  \nPresenting Author email address: monica.biggio@unige.it  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigates , for the first time , cortical correlates of the evoked  Hand Blink \nReflex (HBR) and its preparation using functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Cortical \nactivity  prior to the evoking stimulus  was found to be lower in the far position, with  a generally  \nincreased activity in sensorimotor areas. Immediately after the stimulus , BA44 exhibited \ndeactivation in the near position . BA44 activity correlated negatively with HBR intensity . \n \nIntroduction:  HBR is a subcortical defensive response, known to dramatically increase when the stimulated hand is \nstatically positioned inside the defensive peripersonal space (DPPS) of the face. A top -down modulation of HBR has \nbeen proposed, particularly involving the  ventral intraparietal and polysensory zone areas related to DPPS \nrepresentation. Here we aim to investigate cortical correlations  using fNIRS.  \n \nMethods: HBR was evoked in 28 healthy participants by administering transcutaneous electrical stimuli  (ES) to the \nright median nerve of the wrist in two target positions: with the arm at maximal extension (FAR) and with the maximal \nelbow flexion, with the hand near the face (NEAR). For each position condition, 15 trials were collected. Each trial \nconsisted of  two phases , each lasting 10 seconds : the former to assess brain activity before stimulus arrival  (PRE-\nSTIMULUS ), and the second starting with stimulus arrival  (STIMULUS ), containing the HBR response . Optodes  \nwere arranged resulting in a total of 44 standard channels (3cm) and 8 short -separation channels. For each participant , \nthe fNIRS signal was pre -processed: channels with low signal –to–noise ratio were discarded; intensity data were \nconverted to attenuation changes and motion artifacts were corrected by applying spline and wavelet motion correction \ntechniques; a band -pass f ilter (0.01 -3 Hz) was applied, and the mean hemodynamic response for each participant , \nposition condition, trial phase, and channel was recovered using a general linear model approach . This also led to \nremoving physiological noise by regressing the most correlated short -separation channel from each standard channel. \nThen, we averaged channels belonging to the same Brodmann's area (BA) obtaining 11 regions of interest. The mean \nvalues of Oxy-hemoglobin responses for PRE-STIMULUS  and STIMULUS  condition s were computed in an interval  \nbetween 1 and 6s after the onset of each phase.   \n \nResults: PRE-STIMULUS analysis showed a significant effect of POSITION, i.e. , an overall lower cortical activity \nin PRE -STIMULUS_FAR with respect to PRE -STIMULUS_NEAR. Also, a significant POSITION * BA interaction \nindicated higher  activity in BA4 and 3 in PRE -STIMULUS_NEAR. In STIMULUS condition, significant effects of \nBA and HEMISPHERE were found, indicating higher  activation of BA4 and 3, in particular in the left hemisphere, \nand a significant deactivation of BA44 in the NEAR with respect to the FAR condition.   \nFurther, we found a significant negative correlation between the activity of the right BA44 and the intensity of HBR  \nin STIMULUS  conditions , i.e., the lower the right BA44 activity the higher the amplitude of HBR   \n \nConclusion:  HBR preparation varies according to arm position, particularly in somatosensory and motor areas, \npredisposing the system to an increased response, or conversely deactivating the system when a response is not \nrequired  and the stimulus is implicitly perceived as not risky. These areas remain active after stimulus administration , \nwith no significant difference between positions. After the stimulus , right and left BA44 appear  to be deactivated. \nRight BA44 has been associated with the judgement of the position of visual and somatosensory stimuli relative to \ntheir body midline , and also with risk assessment and aversion.  \n \nAcknowledgment:  Supported by FISM - Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla – cod. 2022/R -Multi/040 and financed \nor co -financed with the µ5 per mille’ public funding  184 of 398",

T his study  \nuses continuous glucose monitoring and diffuse optical tomography  (DOT)  to investigate the \nhaemodynamic response  to these events . 60 preterms were recruited, with the glycaemic events \ncurrently classified in 41 patients . Among these, p reterms that  exhibited hypo -glycaem ia only  \n(14/41)  were selected for this preliminary analysis . A technique for correcting motion artefact \n‘trains’ was developed to pre-process  the data and currently analysis of DOT has been performed \non 5/14 preterms , on several events . Analysis of all 14 hypo only preterms are planned with group \nwide comparisons.  \n \nIntroduction:  Very preterm neonates ( < 32 weeks gestational age (GA)) are prone to experience hyper and hypo -\nglycaemia . In current clinical practice preterm s blood glucose concentrations (BGC) are sampled approximately twice \na day, with the aim to regul ate BGC to maintain a euglycemic  state. This practice neither  considers  any individual \ndifferences in the preterm such as the variability in thresholds for glycaemic  events, which currently lacks consensus \n[1], nor the newborn’s brain reaction to these metabolic changes . This study aims to investigate the relationship \nbetween glycaemic  episodes and brain haemodynamics in preterm s, using diffuse optical tomography (DOT).  \nMethods: Very preterm infants were enrolled from March 2020 in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the University  \nHospital of Padova. 60 patients were  recruit ed with a median GA of 30 weeks. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)  \nwas car ried out on all patients  using a Medtronic C GM system inserted in the t high. Glucose data was sampled every \n5 minutes  and four different glycaemic  episodes were classified, severe hyper ( >180 mg/ dl), mild hyper ( >144 mg/ dl), \nmild hypo ( <72 mg/ dl) and severe hypo ( <47 mg/ dl). Events were defined as at least 3 consecutive non-euglycemia  \nsamples with 15-minute eugly cemia baselines before and after . Events were  synchronized with NIRS dat a, which \nwere  acquired using a continuous wave device (NTS, Gowerlabs), consisting of 8 sources and 8 detectors  (10 Hz , 64 \nchannels at  780 nm and 850 nm respectively),  distributed evenly across the scalp. The NIRS data was processed using \nHomer2 [2], NIRFAST [3] and custom -made  algorithms on Matlab (Mathworks, 2023a).  In particular, a  novel motion \ncorrection approach was developed to deal with trains of motion artifacts  and clean the data.  \nResults: To date, glucose data from 41 preterms have  been classified, of which  14 exhibited solely hypo -glycaemic  \nevents (mean  5 events & ı = 9, mean 114 minutes & ı = 78 minutes) , which were  the first target for analysis. NIRS \ndata was split into 10 minute segments across the event based upon  features of the BCG curve and has been analysed  \non 5 preterm s on a single subject level , using DOT to obtain changes in HbO, Hb and HbT. Further analysis of the \nremaining 9 hypo -only preterms are planned for this phase of the study.  \n \nFigure 1 A. DOT acquisition, B. Motion artefact train correction, C.

A technique for correction of motion \nartefact ‘trains’ was devel oped and the haemodynamic respons e has been investigated in 5/14 preterms with a \ncollective group level analysis planned to obtain a relationship between hypo -glycaemia and cerebral haemodynamics.  \nAcknowledgements : This work is supported by grant GR -2019 -12368539 from the Italian Ministry of Health and by \ngrant IRP2020 -StarG  from Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Città della Speranza.

    "Cortical correlates of treadmill walking: walking speeds  and \nhandrails  holding effects \n \nLaura Bonzano1,2, Monica Biggio1, Costanza Iester1, Davide Cattaneo3,4, Simone Cutini5, Ambra Bisio6, \nLudovico Pedullà7, Alessandro Torchio3, Marco Bove2,6 \n \n1 Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa,  Italy \n2 IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy,   \n3 IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Milan, Italy  \n4 Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy  \n5 Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy  \n6 Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Human Physiology, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy  \n7 Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Scientific Research Area, Genoa, Italy  \nPresenting Author email address:  laura.bonzano@unige.it  \n \nAbstract:  In the rehabilitation field, the use of handrails in treadmill systems is under  debate, but it \nhas been studied from a behavioral perspective. By using fNIRS, w e investigated the cortical \ncorrelates of treadmill walking under different conditions (3 or 5 Km/h; holding or not holding onto \nthe handrails).  Significant differences in cortical activation were found between the two walking \nspeeds in the unsupported condition ; the use of handrails reduced these differences.  Additionally, at \nthe highest speed and without the use of handrails, a stronger pattern of task -based functional \nconnectivity was observed . \n \nIntroduction:  Controversial results have been reported on the use of handrails during treadmill walking . Indeed,  \nholding the hands onto the treadmill handrails might not imply a representative walking pattern, in terms of an \necological perspective, since it encourages bad posture and prevents the natural stride.  Nevertheless, this issue  has \nbeen investigated  from a behavioral perspective. To our knowledge, the effects of holding handrails have never been \nassessed  with neuroimaging techniques.  We conducted  an fNIRS study in healthy volunteers in order to explore  the \ncortical correlates of treadmill walking in different conditions (3  or 5 Km/h; holding or not onto the handrails).  \n \nMethods: We assessed cortical activity during  treadmill walking in 24 young  (27.0ௗ±ௗ6.3 years, 13 females) , healthy \nparticipants with fNIRS . A box -car design was implemented, with 30 s of walking on a treadmill and 30 s of rest in \nan upright position. Walking was performed in four different randomized conditions , each  repeated eight times : the \nspeed was set at 3 km/h or at 5 km/h, and participants kept their hands on the handrails (V3_HOLD and V5_HOLD \nconditions, respectively) or walked with a spontaneous swing of the arms (V3_no -HOLD and V5_no -HOLD \nconditions, respectively). During the rest blocks, participants kept their hands on the handrails  or their arms along \nthe body , depending on the task condition. Sixteen sources and 16 detectors were arranged to form 44 standard \nchannels (3 cm) covering the frontal, prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal areas. In addition, 8 short -separation (SS) \nchannels (8 mm) were used. The fNIRS signal was pre -processed through custom scripts based on Homer3  (spline \nand wavelet motion correction techniques; band -pass filter (0.01 -3 Hz)). A  General Linear Model was applied, with \nthe most correlated SS channel signal as an additional regressor to reduce the physiological noise. HbO \nconcentration changes of channels belonging to the same hemisphere and Brodmann ’s Area (BA) were averaged.  \nFurthermore, we investigated  differences in task -based functional connectivity  (FC)  across the walking conditions.  \n \nResults: HbO concentration changes were influenced by  task condition  (Friedman’s ANOVA  with Bonferroni \ncorrection) . Specifically, cortical activation elicited by the task  in the no -HOLD condition was significantly higher \nwhen speed was 5 km/h with respect to 3 km/h in the left BA10 , left BA3 and BA39 , and right BA10, BA9, BA8, \nBA3 and BA40. Furthermore, HbO concentration change s in the left BA40 were  significantly higher when speed was \n5 km/h with respect to 3 km/h , both in the no -HOLD and in the HOLD condition.  The analysis of BA -to-BA pairwise \ntask-related FC  revealed that the correlation value between L -BA10 and L -BA40 was statistically different: it was \nclose to zero in the V3_HOLD condition, whereas it was extremely high (r=0.80) in the V5_no -HOLD condition.  \n \nConclusion:  Speed (3 or 5 km/h) affects cortical activation during walking  on a treadmill, and d ifferences in activation \nbetween speeds are mitigated when using the handrails . Also, s tronger functional connectivity occurs at the highest \nspeed and no handrails use . We suggest that s peed and handrails use play a key role in walking cortical activity \npatterns , therefore they are important  ingredients to take into account  when planning a rehabilitation program.  186 of 398",
    "Brain Network Analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease and \nMild Cognitive Impairment using HD-DOT \n \nEmilia Butters1,2,†  Liam Collins -Jones3  Rickson Mesquita4   \nDeepshi kha Acharya1  Sruthi Srinivasan1  John O’Brien2  Li Su2,5  Gemma Bale1,6 \n1 Dept. of Engineering , University of Cambridge  \n2 Dept. of Psychiatry , University of Cambridge  \n3 Dept. of Clinical Neuroscience , University of Cambridge  \n4 School  of Computer Science , University of Birmingham  \n5 Dept. of Neuroscience , University of Shefﬁeld  \n6 Dept. of Physics , University of Cambridge  \n \n† eb857@cam.ac.uk   \n \nAbstract. Dementia is associated with altered resting  state connectivity , measures of \nwhich could aid in the early detection and monitoring  of dementia . Due to its practical \nadvantages, high-density diffuse optical tomography is ideally placed  to detect these \nalterations , but it has never previously been applied to dementia . We investigat e \nresting  state  functional connectivity  using a graph -theoretical approach  in individuals \nwith Mild Cognitive Impairment (early memory decline ) and with Alzheimer’s \nDisease, and healthy controls . In this abstract,  we present preliminary  results  which \nsuggest that clinical populations have alterations in network efﬁciency and resilience ; complete results will be presented at the conference.  \n \nIntroduction . Resting  state network  differences  may offer  markers for the early detection and \nmonitoring  of dementia . Such  differences have previously been identiﬁed using functional magnetic \nresonance imaging (fMRI)1 and electroencephalography2, but these methods  cannot be easily nor \nwidely deployed . High -density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT) is a non -invasive optical \nimaging method that maps changes in cortical haemoglobin  concentration , which is a marker of \nfunctional activation.  HD-DOT is low-cost, wearable, silent, portable, and tolerant of motio n, thus \nenabling the brain to be studied outside  of the restrictive environment associated with  methods such \nas fMRI . Because HD-DOT  has potential for scalable clinical use , we investigate whether this method  \ncan identify  resting  state network  differences between individuals with and without memory problems . \n \nMethods . HD-DOT data was collected  over the pre -frontal cortex during a ﬁve minute  resting period  \nusing the Lumo (Gowerlabs Ltd ., UK ), a device compris ing 36 sources and 48 detectors  (1728 channels ). \nWe collected data in the home setting  from individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease ( n=15)  and with  Mild \nCognitive Impairment ( MCI, n=15), and from age matched healthy controls ( HC, n=14) . Further data \ncollection is ongoing. Photogrammetry was used to obtain optode and cranial landmark locations . \nBecause cortical atrophy is widespread in dementia3, structural T1 -weighted MRI scans were  acquired  \nfor individuals belonging to  clinical groups , to enable accurate source localisation . Cortical oxygenation \nmaps were reconstructed and parcellated using  the Schaefer atlas . To evaluate resting  state network \ndifferences, we constru e the brain network as a graph  in which  node s correspond  to parcel s, and edge s \ncorrespond to  functional connection s between t hem . Graph -theoretical metrics  can then be used to \nquantify patterns of connectivity , and differences across groups can be tested for statistical signiﬁcance.  \n \nResults . Figure 1 shows several graph theoretical \nmetrics derived from a subsample of HC and MCI . \nThese suggest  lower  global efﬁciency (efﬁciency of \ninformation transfer ) and high er assortativity \n(connectivity of nodes with similar properties)  in MCI.  \n \nConclusions and future work.  Our p reliminary work \nsuggests differences in network resilience and \nefﬁciency between HC and MCI.  In the coming months, \nwe will apply  these methods to a larger sample and \nstatistically compare any  alterations across groups.   \n \nReferences  \n1 Galvin et al. (2011).

This has been found to \nproduce  self-other neural overla ps in the vmPFC  (Broom e t al., 2021) . Here we investigated self -\nother activa tions by measuring  individuals mPFC responses to their own/familiar character/stranger \nname . Participants were 39 UK-based MCU fans . Name call events  occurred whilst participants  \nwatched  film cli ps of their most familiar character , colou red in a mandala colouring book and \nwatched nature landscape videos . PFC activity was recorded with a 22 channel Shimadzu \nLIGHTNIRS system.  The d ata is currently  being analyse d and will be ready for pr esentation at the \nconference .  \n \nIntroduction:  Stemming from our previous research  on the effect s of theatre training and characterization  on an \nactor ’s sense of self (Greaves & Pinti et al., 2022) here we investigated a  different  form of the self-character \nrelationshi p. Rather than professional actors , this study  focuse d on the bond that  non-actors  may have with char acters \nfrom a media franchise they are fans of. This focus  can provide  insight into h ow the sense of self may be affected or \ndeveloped b y parasocial bonds.  Parasocial bonds are when  individuals have one -sided attachments with a media figure \nor fictional character. Previous research has found that high trait identification with a fictional character can lead to a \nself-other neural overlap in the vmPFC , suggesting the effects of parasocial bonds (Broom et al., 2021). There fore, \nwe selected one popular franchise to zoom in on  – the Marvel Cine matic Universe (MCU)  and aimed to measure self -\nother activation s in a sim ilar st yle to our actor research where we replicate d the methodology of Kampe et al., (20 03) \nand measure d PFC activat ion when  hearing ones own na me compared t o other names .  \n \nMethods: Participants w ere 39 UK-based MCU fans with no acting experience . PFC activity was measured with a \n22-channel Shimadzu LIGHTNIRS functional near -infrared system . A Biosignalsplux physiology system was used to \nmeasure breathing rate and head acceleration.  Prior to the recording period , participants completed a HEXACO -60-\nself personality  rating scale (Ash ton & Lee , 2009). During the recording period p articipants were instructed  to watch \nfilm clip s from 1 familiar MCU character ’s film/ series  (this character was prior to the expe riment) , colour in a mandala \ncolouring book , and watch  nature landsca pe videos. Each task was conducted whilst seated, lasted 2 minutes and w as \nrepeated 4 times in the same listed order.  During each task , participants heard their own name, familiar character name \nand a stranger name played twice from  a speak er at pseud orandom time intervals . After the  recording period \nparticipants com pleted a HEXACO -60-other personality rating scale for their familiar character.   \n \nResults & Conclusion s: Data col lection is complete. The analysis presented at the conference will focus on the \nsimilarity between participants and their charact er’s personality traits and whether this correlates with their PFC \nactivation when hearing their own/character/stranger name during the experimental and control conditions.  \n \nReferences  \n \nAshton, M.

D’Annunzio of Chieti -Pescara, 65127 Pescara, Italy  \nPresenting Author email address: david.perpetuini@unich.it  \n \nAbstract:  Motivation plays a fundamental role in the field of psychology, as it influences the \ncognitive and behavioral dynamics of individuals. This study aimed to classify subjects' motivation \nfor remembering a visual stimulus. Relying on fNIRS features, a Random Forest classifier was \ndeveloped to distinguish participants who did not want to remember (NWR) a visual stimulus from \nthose who actively wanted to remember (WR) it. On the test data, 71.80% accuracy was reached, \nwhereas during cross -validation, a  mean accuracy of 67.32% (± 3.67%) was obtained. This study \noffers new perspectives for applications where motivation detection is crucial, such as brain -\ncomputer interfaces.  \n \nIntroduction:  Motivation is a fundamental aspect of the human experience  as it influences cognitive and behavioral \ndynamics of individuals . Particularly, in the field of brain -computer interfaces (BCI), motivation  deeply affect s both \nthe performance of the system and the user's ability to effectively interact with it.  In this perspective, class ifying  \nmotivation through machine learning (ML) models trained on brain activity data acquired using ecological \nneuroimaging tools such as functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) is pivotal .  \n \nMethods: This research employed a publicly accessible dataset of 16 subjects' fNIRS data1. The fNIRS signals  in the \ndataset  are sampled at 10 Hz  for 12 seconds. A band -pass 3rd order Butterworth filter (cut-off frequencies: 0.01 and \n0.4 Hz ) and Wavelet -based motion artifact correction  were used in MATLAB 2023b for preprocessing. Two classes \nof 664 samples were created:  participants who did not want to remember (N WR) and who actively wanted to \nremember (WR) . Subsequently, several parameters were computed  for both oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated \n(HbR) hemoglobin on frontal brain channels : total signal energy, mean  and median  concentration, correlation among \nchannels , and General Linear Model (GLM)  β-values . Later, the ML algorithm was implemented in Python, with the \npreprocessed data divided into training (80% of the data) and test (20% of the data)  sets. A wrapper -based f eature  \nselection  procedure delivered  26 features  used to train  Random Forest classifier, configured with 450 decision trees, \na maximum depth of 90, and a seed of 42. Additionally, 10-fold cross -validation was performed to ensure a robust \nevaluation of the model.   \n \nResults: The model achieved an accuracy of 71.80% on the test set, with the first class correctly classified in 72.52% \nof cases and the second in 71.11%. The ROC curve showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77. During cross -\nvalidation, the average accuracy was 67.32% (± 3.67%).  \nThe confusion matrix of the test is reported in Figure 1.  \n \nConclusion:  this study has explored the feasibility to \nclassify the motivation state through ML applied to \nfNIRS . The ability to classify human motivation can \nenable the development of more intuitive and adaptable \nsystems  for BCI . Further research could focus on \nrefining the classification model and identifying new \ninformative fNIRS features indicative of motivation .  \n \nAcknowledgments : this study was partially funded by \nGRANT Pharaon Horizon 2020 #857188, E -MOTIVE .  \n \n1.

It utilises a plasma laser source coupled to \na flexible wavelength selector to access  any wavelength with adjustable bandwidth (3 to 15  nm). \nHyperProbe1.1 capture s images of a 1x1 -cm2 field of view with 15. 63-µm resolution. The setup \nhas been fully characterised: enhanced image contrast, signal -to-noise ratio and stability ensure  \nclearer and more interpretable imagery for quantitative biochemical analysis of the exposed \ncerebral tissue. HyperProbe1.1 will be applied to image fresh tumour  biopsies and  in preclinical \nmodels of glioma . \n \nIntroduction : Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is proving valuable in tumor detection, especially for glioma surgery. \nBy capturing detailed  2D spectral information from tissue, it  can help  surgeons  to differentiate between healthy \nand cancerous regions in real -time, guiding precise tumor removal while preserving functional, healthy tissue. \nThis technology  has the potential to significantly  enhance surgical outcomes and could reduce the need for \nadditional procedures, promising improved treatment for patients with brain tumor s. Here we present a full \ncharacterisation  and application of a high spectral density, fast HSI  system  for preclinical investigations , called \nHyperProbe1.1 . This setup has been developed within the framework of the EU -funded HyperProbe consortium \nwith the aim of customising and investigating hyperspectral features to translate to a compact and cost -effective \nclinical prototype that is specifically tailored for the application in neuronavigation during glioma resection.  \nMethods: Hyper Probe1.1 is based on  a plasma laser source  (PLS)  with broad coverage from 250 to 2500 nm, \nensuring high brilliance and stable output  over time. A flexible wavelength selector ( FWS ) automatically  scans \nfor wavelengths between 385 nm and 1015 nm  with adjustable bandwidth (between 3 and 15 nm).  This enables \nthe system to capture hypercubes  composed of images  of a field of view (FOV) of 1x1 -cm2 at up to 127 spectral \nbands (at 5 -nm sampling)  in less than 5 seconds.  \nResults: The HyperProbe1.1  is here fully characterised : spatial resolution was quantified  at 15.63  µm, image \nquality was assessed including image contrast and signal -to-noise ratio , enhancing clarity and interpretability of \nthe imagery for quantitative biochemical analysis of cerebral tissue. The system is used to target the detection and \nquantification on 2D maps of the biochemical composition of brain tissue, in particular by lookin g at physiological \nand pathological  biomarkers,  such as oxy -and deoxyhaemoglobin, cytochrome -c -oxidase and lipid content.    \nConclusion : The HyperProbe1.1  will undergo testing and validation to image fresh glioma biopsies ex vivo  and \nin vivo  on mice models. The system will be the first step in the development of future clinical devices to  be applied \nin vivo  on human patients during routine surgery.  \nFig. 1 a) Schematics and picture of the HyperProbe1.1 setup; b) Spatial resolution of HyperProbe1.1 with line profile at 600 \nnm and; c) Spectral shapes and resolution of the 127 spectral bands of Hyperprobe1.1 . \n191 of 398",

    "Cortical activity and network organisation during oculo -\nmanual vs ocular pursuit: The impact of task adaptation  \nLénaïc Borot1, Ruth Ogden2, Simon J. Bennett1 \n1 School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK  \n2 School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK  \nl.borot@2019.ljmu.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Tracking a moving object is part of many daily activities , and can be achieved using \nsmooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM)  for objects in a fronto -parallel plane . SPEM involve s many \ncortical regions, with the activity of some regions mediated by the presence of retinal input (e.g. \nwhen the object is visible or momentarily occluded). It is also known that the presence of extra -\nretinal input from concurrent upper limb movement can facilitate SPEM . This study aims  to \ninvestigate if and how concurrent upper limb movement influences cortical activity and SPEM, as \nwell as how this is mediated by a short training period .  \n \nIntroduction:  SPEM is known to involve a  large number of cortical areas . The activity of some areas , such as FEF \nand DLPFC, is mediated by the presence of retinal input , and seems to coincide with the reduction in SPEM when a \nmoving object is occluded  [1,2]. It has also been shown that extra -retinal input (e.g. efference and/or afference) from \nconcurrent upper -limb movement can help substitute for the loss of retinal input during an object occlu sion. However, \nto date it has yet to be examined if extra -retinal input from concurrent upper limb movement influences cortical activity \nand network organisation during pursuit of an occluded moving object.  In addition, wh ile it has been shown that \nfacilitation of SPEM by concurrent upper limb tracking is increased after several minutes of training [3] , it is not \nknown if there are reflected  adaptations in cortical activity and network organisation . \n \nMethods: Twenty -eight participants took part in the study. The experiment comprised two testing sessions (pre and \npost), separated by a short training session. Each testing session comprised four conditions , each including 3 trials \n(n=12) . Participants were asked to pursue an object moving horizontally (sinusoidal velocity) with eyes alone (OC  \ntracking ) or with eyes and hand (OM  tracking ). The moving object was either visible during the  entire trial or was \noccluded  for 1 250ms centered to the mid -point of the trajectory . In the short training  session, participants performed \n10 trials of OM tracking without occlusion. Cortical activity was  quantified with functional near infrared spectroscopy \n(NIRSport2). Seven ROIs (MPFC, DLPFC, FEF, MC, IPL, SPL and VC) including 50 long distance channels in total \nwere selected for analysis.  Eye movements were recorded using EyeLink 1000 remote optics system .  \n \nResults: Eye Velocity:  Independently of tracking condition , eye velocity was lower at pre -test and post -test in trials \nwith occlusion than without occlusion. However, eye velocity  was lower in the OC than OM tracking (p < 0.05) . Mean \nO2HB: Across MPFC , DLPFC , and FEF, mean O 2Hb was lower in the OM than OC tracking in trial s with occlusion . \nAlso, mean O 2Hb in MPFC, DLPFC and IPL increased from pre -test to post -test in OC tracking  but remain ed the \nsame in OM tracking . Additionally, at pre -test there was a higher mean O 2Hb in parietal cortex (IPL and SPL) in OM \nthan OC  tracking (p < 0.05).  Local efficiency : When the object was occluded, local efficiency was higher at pre -test \nthan post -test in OC tracking. Local efficiency was also higher in OC than OM tracking at pre -test, but lower in OC \nthan OM tracking at post -test (p < 0.05) .  \n \nConclusion:  Our results show that SPEM, cortical activity and local efficiency are modified as a function of the \npresence of retinal input  from the moving object  and extra retinal input from concurrent upper limb movement . \nAlthough a short period of training did not impa ct upon SPEM, there were adaptations in cortical activity and local \nefficiency . These results could help to better understand cortical function  during oculo -manual  tracking in neurotypical \nadults, as well as providing a basis for future studies of acute and chronic neurological conditions . \n \n1.

    "Hemodynamic response of prefrontal areas \nin the simultaneous control of motor \nand cognitive functions \nin children with ASD, ADHD and depression \n- a pilot study using fNIRS\nChojak M., Korniluk A., Gawron A.\nNeuroeducation Research Lab, Universiti of Marie Curie-Sklodowska, Gleboka 43 Street, Lublin, Poland \nMail: malgorzata.chojak@mail.umcs.pl\nIntroduction:  ASD and ADHD are characterized by attention deficits, poor impulse control and increased motor\nactivity. Depressive disorders in children can be associated with difficulty focusing attention, impaired emotion\ncontrol, increased levels of irritability, and difficulty initiating tasks and the activities (among other motor activities)\nnecessary to complete them. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is primarily responsible for modulating attention,\nmaintaining attention, and controlling emotions as well as motor skills - with studies attributing a greater role to the\nright side of these areas.\nThe aim of the study was to see if difficulties with executive control regarding overactive and underactive areas\noriginate from impaired hemodynamic activity of prefrontal areas  \nMethods:  The study included 29 children aged 6 to 10 years: 7 with ADHD (group 1), 7 with ASD (group 2), 6 with\ndepression (group 3) and 9 without disorders (group 4). The children's diagnosis was based on the results of 6\nstandardized psychological tests and medical records. Neuroimaging data were collected using a near-infrared\nspectroscopy device (fNIRS). The procedure included three tasks: looking at a single point and making no rare\nmovements (task 1); remaining motionless with eyes cupped (task 2); performing mathematical calculations in\nthought and remaining motionless (task 3).\nResults: The results showed greater activity:\n- left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas (channel 4,8) in\nchildren from each group with disorders compared to a\ngroup of neurotypical children in a task requiring attention\nto visual control and large motor skills,\n- central-right areas of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n(channel 5) in children from each group with disorders\ncompared to a group of neurotypical children in a task\nrequiring attention to cognitive task performance and fine\nmotor control.\nConclusion:  Focused attention on motor and cognitive\nactivities in children with ASD, ADHD and depression is\nassociated with an increased hemodynamic response of the\nprefrontal cortex regardless of whether the effect is to\nreduce stimulation or stimulate it.  \nIt can be speculated that therapy for attentional control in\nchildren with ASD, ADHD and depression may follow\nsimilar strategies/procedures/protocols aimed at automating\nthese activities. This may result in a reduction in the\nhemodynamic response of prefrontal areas, an acceleration\nof reaction time, and a reduction in the child's fatigability\nwhen performing tasks involving control and attentional\nprocesses.Figure 1:  Localization of channels with significantly \nhigher HbO activity in the group of children with \ndisorders compared to the group of neurotypical \nchildren (green: task 1; purple: task 3)\n194 of 398",

In  addition,we  developed  an\noptimization procedure for identifying the optimal wavelength for resolving Haemoglobins and\nCytochorme-C-Oxidase concentrations accross the visible and NIR range.\nIntroduction:  Hyperspectral imaging is a non-invasive technique especially adapted for intraoperative functional\nbrain  mapping  applications.  It  allows  the  quantification  of  the  concentration  changes  in  oxy,  deoxygenated\nhemoglobin (HbO2 and Hb) and the oxidative state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO) in brain cortex. A robust\nquantification of these biomarkers is complicated to perform during neurosurgery due to the critical context of the\noperating room. To overcome this issue, we developed a digital instrument simulator based on Monte Carlo\nsimulations to obtain realistic images of exposed brain cortex that can be used to evaluate experimental devices. In\naddition, we developed an optimization procedure for identifying the optimal wavelength to monitor hemodynamic\nand metabolic changes in grey matter.\nMethods: The digital instrument simulator is based on Monte Carlo simulations and consisted on 4 steps: 1- a real\nimage of exposed cortex (A) was segmented in three classes (grey matter, large and small blood vessels). 2- A brain\nvolume was reconstructed (B). 3- White Monte Carlo simulations were executed. 4- Data were reconstructed with\nperturbation of the absorption coefficient (C). An optimization procedure based on the genetic algorithm was used to\nfind the optimal group of 2 and 6 wavelengths for monitoring HbO2 , Hb and oxCCO changes (noise was added to\nthe simulated intensity to find the combination the most robust to noise). This algorithm was applied on a simple\nmodel (cube of grey matter with an inclusion of activated grey matter).\nResults and discussion:  In Figure 1 (D), we can see that the optimization procedure takes advantage of the\nchromophore peaks in the visible range and as demonstrated in Figure 1(E) reduces the error in resolving oxy-\ndeoxy-  haemoglobin  and  ox-red  Cytochrome-C-Oxidase.  Here  we  expand  the  work  by  Arfiler  et  al  [1]  and\ndemonstrated that optical algorithms that incorporate visible and NIR wavelengths can outperform in quantification\naccuracy those that only incorporate NIR wavelengths.\n[1] D.

These devices take advantage of the near infrared light to monitor\ndeep tissues like brain, muscle or placenta. In this study, we developed a Monte Carlo framework\nto evaluate the sensitivity of NIRS devices for monitoring the placenta which a deep layer in the\nmaternal  abdomen.  This  framework  can  be  used  to  optimize  NIRS  acquisition  parameters\n(integration time, source detector separation) before going into clinical applications.\nIntroduction:  Abnormal placenta development is a major cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes. To prevent this,\nthe measurement of the placenta oxygenation can be used to monitor the placental function. For this purpose, NIRS\ndevices has emerged. However, since the maternal abdomen is composed of several layers (skin, adipose tissue,\nmuscle and placenta, see Fig. 1 A), the plaental function may be complex to monitor. In this study, we developed a\nMonte Carlo framework to evaluate the sensitivity of NIRS devices for monitoring the placenta function. This\nframework can be used to optimize NIRS acquisition parameters (integration time, source detector separation...)\nbefore going into clinical applications.\nMethods: We developed a Monte Carlo framework to model a multi-layered tissue (A) and a NIRS device with 8\ndetectors (1 to 8 cm source-detector separations). We created a look up table of Monte Carlo quantities (diffuse\nreflectance and sensitivity indexes) by considering changes of several parameters of the model: layers thicknesses,\nblood volume, oxygen saturation and melanin volume fraction (51840 simualtions). The sensitivity indexes (C) were\ncomputed for each layer with the sensivity profile (B) which indicates the probability of detected photons to carry\nthe contribution of the layer N (skin, adipose tissue, muscle, placenta). We also used a solid multi-layered phantom\nto calibrate Monte Carlo simulations and evaluate the probability of a measurement to be above the noise level.\nResults and discussion:  The Monte Carlo framework is a powerful tool to evaluate the capability of NIRS device to\nmonitor deep tissue oxygenation. We showed that a source-detector separation of 3 or 4 cm can be used to monitor\nthe placental function under certain conditions (layer thickness, and blood volume). This tool will be improved in\nthe future to reduce calculation time, which is currently very long (≈ 1 week on a computation grid using a NVIDIA\nGK210 GPU).Figure 1: Monte Carlo pipeline for optimizing NIRS measurements for placenta monitoring.

Infants’ brain responses were  recorded \nusing fNIRS during the audio presentation of the two languages. A control group of age-matched  \nnormal hearing infants (n=45) was also tested. Preliminary results suggest similar processing \nabilities across the two groups for the native language compared to the non -native one.  \n \nIntroduction:  At birth, newborns show sensitivity to the rhythm of their native language, i.e. the language they heard \nprenatally, being able to discriminate it from a rhythmically different language (Pe ña et al., 2003, May et al., 2018). \nA current hypothesis (Gervain,  2018; Nallet & Gervain, 2021) suggests that prosody provides the basis of early speech \nperception and helps infants discover other linguistic units after birth, when the full -spectrum speech signal is \navailable. Prenatal experience is thus h ypothesized to be foundational for language learning. But what happens when \nthe prenatal experience is disrupted?  To investigate this, we tested the ability of 0 -10-month -old infants with different \ndegrees of hearing loss (HL) to discriminate their native language (Italian) from a rhythmically different unfamiliar \nlanguage (English).  \nMethods: 54 HL infants were tested in a simple block design paradigm . Sentences in both languages were  presented \nforward and backward. Backward speech, with perturbed temporal features, is a standardly used non -linguistic control \n(Peña et al., 2003). A control group of 69 age-matched normal hearing (NH) infants was also tested. Infants’ brain \nresponses were  recorded using fNIRS with a montage of 20 channels covering the frontal, temporal, and parietal \nregions, bilaterally  (eight sources and eight detectors , source -detector separation : 3 cm , two wavelengths of 760 and \n850 nm; sampling rate : 20.34 Hz) . After preprocessing (pipeline described in Gemignani & Gervain, 2021), 31 HL \nsubjects and 45 NH subjects were kept for subsequent statistical analysis. W e will conduct  cluster -based permutation \nanalysis to identify clusters of channels in \nwhich a significant difference in \nconcentration changes between the \nconditions is present. In the two groups, we \nwill investigate the influence of two factors \non brain responses: familiarity with the \nlanguage (native  Italian vs unfamiliar \nEnglish) and the direction of presentation \n(forward vs backward). In the HL group, the \nimpact of the hearing thresholds will be \nanalyzed as a continuous variable . \nResults: Preliminary results suggest that \nboth NH and HL infants show positive, \ncanonical hemodynamic responses to Italian, \nbut inverted responses to English . \nConclusion:  If found, a deficit in prosodic \nperception in HL infants could provide \ntheoretical insights into the role of prenatal \nand early postnatal experience in language \ndevelopment, as well as important \napplications for screening and intervention in \nthis population .

    "Learning repetition-based regularities in speech:  \na NIRS study with 7-month-old infants  \n \nGaia Lucarini1,2, Alessia Pasquini1, Judit Gervain1,2,3  \n \n1 Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padua, Italy  \n2 Padova Neuroscience Center, University of Padua, Italy  \n3 Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center, CNRS & Universit é Paris Cit é, France  \ngaia.lucarini@phd.unipd.it  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigates the ability to discriminate  non-adjacent repetitions  from diversity -\nbased controls  in 38 7 -month -old infants.  Infants’ brain responses were  recorded using fNIRS during \nthe audio presentation of the two grammars. While newborns fail to discriminate them , 7-month -old \ninfants succeed and show  the preparedness to process highly variable linguistic materials.  \n \nIntroduction:  Infants exhibit a robust capacity for learning rules from speech. By 6 months of age, they can encode \nboth repetition - and diversity -based regularities between adjacent syllables (e.g., ABB: ‘‘mubaba” vs ABC: \n‘‘mubage”, respectively; de la Cruz -Pavía & Ger vain, 2021 , 2023 ). By contrast, non -adjacent repetitions (ABA, e.g. \n“bamuba”) have been investigated only in newborns (Gervain  et al., 2008), who fail to discriminate them from \ndiversity -based controls (ABC).  Since non -adjacent dependencies play an important role in language, in this study we \ninvestigate if 7 -month -old infants can discriminate non -adjacent repetitions from ABC controls using Near -Infrared \nSpectroscopy (NIRS).  \nMethods: 72 5-9-month -old infants were tested in a simple block design paradigm, where sequences from a repetition -\nbased ABA artificial grammar and from an unstructured ABC control grammar were  presented. Both the ABA and \nthe ABC grammars were  matched in all nonstructural properties. Infants’ brain responses were  recorded using fNIRS  \nwith a montage of 20 channels covering the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, bilaterally  (eight sources and eight \ndetectors , source -detector separation : 3 cm , two wavelengths of 760 and 850 nm; sampling rate : 20.34 Hz) . After \npreprocessing (pipeline described in Gemignani & Gervain, 2021 ), 38 subjects (197.74 days; SD = 34.35; 19 female ) \nwere kept for subsequent statistical analysis . We conducted a cluster -based permutation analysis to identify clusters \nof channels in which a significant difference in concentration changes between the two conditions was found.   \nResults: The grand average results for oxyHb and deoxyHb concentration changes are presented in the Figure . A \ncanonical positive response to both grammars is presented in bilateral temporal areas suggesting the processing of \nboth grammars. Whereas inverted responses to both conditions  appear  in more parietal regions, suggesting habituation \nto the task . The cluster -based permutation analysis revealed  statistical differences between the two grammars in a left \nfronto -temporal cluster (ch. 1 & 6) and in a right parietal cluster (ch. 20,  21, 23) in deoxy Hb.  \nConclusion:  7-month -old infants, compared to newborns, succeeded in the processing of non -adjacent repetitions  \ncompared to a control grammar . Moreover, since positive canonical hemodynamic response s to both repetition - and \ndiversity -based regularities  were  found in bilateral temporal areas , 7-month -old infants show preparedness  to process \nhighly variable linguistic materials, such as words, which are composed of highly variable sequences .  \n \n \n \nFigure .

    "Can 7-month-old infants extract affective information \nindependently by  sensory modality?\nChuchu Jia1, Letizia Della Longa1, Laura Carnevali1, Judit Gervain123,Teresa Farroni12\n1Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padua, Italy  \n2Padova Neuroscience Center, University of Padua, Italy  \n3Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition Center, CNRS & University of Paris, France  \nEmail address: chuchu.jia@phd.unipd.it  \nAbstract:  Infants' perception of emotional changes is crucial for social and emotional development. \nResearch shows preverbal infants' sensitivity to human emotional cues and their ability to extract \nnonverbal affective information. However, how 7 -month -old infants integrate facial and vocal \nexpressions to extract affective information, and their neural mechanisms, require s further \ninvestigation. Through behavioral and fNIRS experiments, we aim to reveal infants' sensitivity  and \nneural representation  to consistent multimodal expressions, highlighting their ability to extract \ninvariant affective information  across modalities, contributing t o our understanding of infant \naffective comprehension.  \nIntroduction:  The ability to perceive emotional changes is of primary importance for social living. Though emotional \nsignals are often conveyed by multiple modalities , how emotional changes in vocal and facial modalities  are integrate d \ninto a unified percept across  development has yet many open questions. This research aims to investigate how \nmultimodal integration of expression affects the extraction of affective information in 7 -month -old infants , as well as \nbrain function and brain network connectivity in infants when processing different multimodal emotions.  \nMethods:  Based on  the power analysis, thirty -eight  healthy, full -term 7 -month -old infants are recruited from BabyLab  \nat the  University of Padua , where data collection is currently ongoing . Two separate experiments are running . In the \nbehavioral  experiment , participants are presented with two dynamic facial expressions  (e.g., happy and angry) , \naccompanied by a vocal expression that matches one of the emotions conveyed by the presented faces , with either \nneutral or nonsense phrases . Looking times  are recorded throughout the experiment. In the NIRS experiment, \nparticipants are presented with congruent and incongruent multimodal expressions sequentially, and the fNIRS data \nare recorded throughout the experiment.  \nExpected Results: For behavioral  experiments, we hypothesize  that infants are sensitive to the common affective \ninformation shared by facial and vocal cues, even when presented with nonsensical speech . For NIRS experiments, \nwe expect that a.) Congruent facial and vocal expressions elicit selected emotion -related brain areas, particularly OFC, \nACC , and vmPFC (Fig. 1); b.) Congruent facial and vocal expressions generate more efficient processing, eliciting \nhigher global efficiency and lower network diameter.  \nPossible Conclusion:  The results  would  suggest that  7-\nmonth -old infants are able to extract  invariant properties \ncommon to facial and vocal expressions, even in the \npresence of nonsensical speech.  Furthermore, infants' \nbrains exhibit different neural representations when \nperceiving different multimodal emotions . This would  \ndemonstrate  that infants' understanding of emotions is \nconceptual rather than solely dependent on perceptual \nfeatures . \nSelected References  \n1.Marno, H, et al. “Can You See What I Am Talking about?\nHuman Speech Triggers Referential Expectation in Four -\nMonth -Old Infants.” Scientific Reports  5, (2015) .\n2.Gervain, J, et al.

    "Exploring the effects of fNIRS Paradigms: Event -Related vs. \nBlock Design in Go/NoGo  Tasks  \nLetizia Contini1*, Rebecca Re1,2 and Paola Pinti3,4  \n \n1 Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Fisica, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan  \n2Istituto  di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan  \n3 Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London, London WC1E  7JL \n4Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT3  \nletizia.contini@polimi.it  \n \nAbstract:  To support n eurocognitive  research  trends towards naturalistic experimental designs, i n \nthis study we investigate if block - and event -related designed experiments elicit different patterns \nof brain activity measured by fNIRS. Data were recorded in a group of adults performing block - and \nevent -related designed Go/NoGo tasks. Results show differences in the localization and amplitude \nof hemodynamic responses between the two designs, with a greater  agreement with previous \nliterature in the block -designed task.  \n \nIntroduction:  Neuro cognitive  research is recently moving  towards naturalistic frameworks  to investigate cognitive \nprocesses as they manifest in the real-world. Event-related  (ER)  designs may be more suitable at mimicking real -\nworld demands. However, in fNIRS experiments, block designs remain prevalent, eliciting stronger and less noisy \nhemodynamic responses but  limiting , at least partially , the adherence to real -world situations. It is still unclear if task \ndesign has an impact on the localization of brain activity.  This study aims to fill this gap comparing  results obtained \nfor the same Go/NoGo  task using an ER or a block design.  \nMethods: fNIRS data from 23 channels (+1 short channel) were recorded over the prefrontal cortex in 19 healthy \nadults performing  two computer ized Go/NoGo  tasks, designed in a fast ER and block -design fashion . The block design  \nincluded  12 blocks comprising 6 Go and 6 mixed (Go/No -Go) trials  of 30s each, spaced by  jittered  rest periods 8-12s. \nFor the ER design, participants completed 6 runs  of 60s each. Three stimuli,  Go, NoGo and n ot-event s, were presented \nrandomly with an average intertrial interval  (ITI)  of 1s. fNIRS data were preprocessed and short -channel regressed \nout. For the ER design,  the average  response to the not-event was subtracted to the Go and NoGo average time series \nto correct for the short ITI1. Finally, the  average response amplitude in 6 ROIs were extracted and entered one sample \nt-test to localize  brain  activity  and assess differences in such patterns between the two designs.  \nResults: We found notable differences in the response amplitude between the two tasks at different locations. For the \nER design, higher amplitudes were recorded in the frontal -polar cortex for both Go and NoGo events and HbO and \nHbR. Conversely, for the block design, higher responses were recorded in the dorsolateral prefrontal area (Figure, \nleft). Moreover, a discrepancy emerged in the averaged responses: the response to Go events presents a much higher \namplitude compared to NoGo events in the ER task, while mixed blocks show higher amplitude compared to Go \nblocks (Figure, right), suggesting stronger responses are associated to the inhibition task. Overall, results obtained for \nthe block design align with previous literature2, and the origin of the observed discrepancies must be further \ninvestigated. Nonetheless,  consistency of responses recorded for Go and NoGo events, across channels and throughout \ntime, demonstrated the robustness of the ER approach. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated that even reducing the \nER dataset down to one single run  maintained reliability in the response reconstruction, which is promising towards \nmore naturalistic settings where a large number of \nevents might not be viable.  \nConclusion:  This study presents encouraging results in \nthe direction of a widening of the use of ER designs in \nfNIRS applications, such as the robustness shown by the \nshape of the retrieved responses to different events and \nacross channels. However, when comparing the se \nresults with the ones obtained for an analogous block \ndesign task, some discrepancies emerge, highlighting \nthe necessity for deeper  investigation  into differences \namong experimental designs.  \n   \n1.Schroeter, M.

    "Establishing Responsible Standards in fNIRS Research \nthrough International Data Governance  \n \nAleksandra Landowska, Damian Eke, Max L. Wilson , Horia A. Maior \n \nSchool of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK   \nPresenting Author email address: aleksandra.landowska@nottingham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Our research aims to  develop and implement International Data Governance guidelines \nfor fNIRS through Responsible Research and Innovation workshops , to establish a framework for \nethical, legal, and secure management of fNIRS data internationally. The lack of an established IDG \nframework highlights the need for a standardised approach that ensures responsible fNIRS data use, \nrespecting international reg ulations and ethical norms. We further employ qualitative methods for \ndata collection and analysis  to finalise th e definitions of the guidelines for fNIRS . This initiative \nunites fNIRS  developers, researchers, and policymakers to enhance ethical standards and promote \ninternational neuroscience collaboration.  \n \nIntroduction:  The design and use of fNIRS, like many technologies, raise s ethical concerns including privacy, \nconfidentiality, informed consent, and the potential for dual use of concern.  Despite its importance, data governance \nhas received limited attention in the fNIRS communit y1, underscoring the need for comprehensive guidelines that \naddress data -sharing, ethical, and legal challenges.  Moreover, th e recent advancements in AI highlight the importance \nfor fNIRS data governance within a contex t of AI application.  Our research aims to  develop International Data \nGovernance (IDG) guidelines for fNIRS  research  and to establish principles and practices for the ethical, legal, and \nsecure sharing and management of neuroscience data internationally. Although there are some existing standards \nregarding fNIRS data management  and sharing such as BIDS2, there is a lack of international data governance \nframework t hat would ensure  responsible, ethical norms , and regulations for fNIRS data.   \n \nMethods: Our workshop method  employ s the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework , and more \nspecifically the RRI Prompts and Practice Cards3 to develop IDG for fNIRS . The RRI framework introduces concepts \nand scenarios designed to encourage reflection on the ethical, social, and environmental implications of research \nprojects.  The 2-hour workshops  are being  held online to bring together an international community of stakeholders, \nsuch as fNIRS  hardware and software developers, researchers, and experts in brain data governance. The main \nobjectives of the workshop are to familiarize the fNIRS community with the RRI framework and to create targeted \nIDG guidelines specifically for fNIRS. These guid elines aim to standardize protocols to tackle common data \ngovernance issues such as data privacy, bias, equitable access, and international sharing, ensuring adherence to \ninternational regulations and ethical standards. Recordings of the workshops are bein g analysed  qualitatively  using  \nThematic Analysis4 to further inform the final definition  of fNIRS -focused  IDG guidelines.  \n \nConclusions: This initiative strives to enhance international ethical standards, improve data sharing practices, and \nfoster scientific innovation and collaboration across the global fNIRS and broader neuroscience communities. Through \nthis collaborative effort, the glob al fNIRS community is working together to cultivate a more ethical, secure, and \ncooperative future in neuroscience research and innovation.

    "Reconstructing fNIRS signal with Generative Deep  \nLearning Model  \n \nYingxu Zhia,1, Baiqiang Zhanga,1, Bingxin Xub, Haijing Niua,* \n \na State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China ,  \nb Beijing Key Laboratory of Information Service Engineering, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China.  \n1 These authors contributed equally to this work.  \n*Corresponding Author: Haijing Niu, E -mail:  niuhjing@bnu .edu.cn   \n \nAbstract:  Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging non -invasive \nneuroimaging technique with increasing applications across various fields. However,  factors  like \nhead motion  and physiological noise often decrease  the quality of fNIRS signals. To solve  this issue, \nwe propose d a generative deep learning model for reconstructing fNIRS time series  with poor \nquality . Our  results showed  accurate reconstruction of poor time series in fNIRS signal while \npreserving functional connectivity consistency betwee n channels. These findings underscore the \npotential of generative deep learning in restoring poor fNIRS signals, thereby providing high-quality  \ndata for clinical diagnosis and brain research.  \n \nIntroduction:  In the field of brain imaging, methods such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and fNIRS  often encounter \nchallenges related to low signal -to-noise ratio in collected data. Factors like head motion and physiological noise cause  \nthe degradation of  signal. Research in EEG and fMRI has started addressing poor time series, but hasn't fully utilized \nhistorical information and sequence dependencies. Furthermore, there's been no related work in fNIRS.  To bridge this \ngap, we propose d a generative deep learning model tha t effectively captures the historical information within fNIRS \ntime series and their connectivity with other time series , enabling the reconstruction of poor signals.  \n \nMethods: In this study, we employed a multichannel continuous wave near -infrared imaging system (Hui Chuang, \nChina) to collect resting -state fNIRS data from 124 healthy elderly individuals (age = 64.8±5.92 years). After \npreprocessing, we divided all subject data into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio.  During the forward pass of the \nmodel, the time -series data of each subject sequentially passed through multi -scale convolutional layers, gated \nrecurrent unit (GRU) layers, and linear regression layers to capture spatial and temporal changes in the data. Af ter \nobtaining the reconstruct ed data, we computed the correlation coefficient between the reconstruct ed and original  time \nseries  to evaluate the accurac y of channel reconstruct ion. Additionally, we performed significance analysis on the \nfunctional connectivity matrices of the reconstruct ed and original  time series to assess whether the model's \nreconstruct ion results could maintain stable spatial \nconnectivity relationships.  \n \nResults: Our model achieved successful reconstruction \nof poor channels, with an average correlation of 0.8 in \nsingle -channel reconstruction (mean = 0.8±0.14; Figure \n1A). This indicates an accurate reconstruction. \nFurthermore, the reconstructed channels exhibit a \nsignificant positive correlation with the original \nfunctional connectivity matrix (p < 0.001; Figure 1D), \ndemonstrating the preservation of their functional \nrelationships. This stability extends to multi -channel \nreconstruction tasks as well.  \n \nConclusion:   \nWe have proposed an effective generative deep learning \nmodel for reconstructing poor fNIRS time series data. It \ndemonstrates good reconstruct ive accuracy and \npreserves the functional relationships . This offers a new \nperspective for obtaining high -quality data in the field \nof brain functional imaging.   \nFigure 1: Model performance.

    "Time-on-task effect on cognitive load-related cortical \nactivity: An fNIRS investigation with healthy adults  \n \nSélima Zahar1,2, Julie Hudry1, Dimitri Van De Ville2,3 \n1- Brain Health Department, Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, Nestlé Research, Lausanne, Switzerland  \n2- Medical Image Processing Lab, Neuro -X Institute, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Geneva, Switzerland  \n3- Department of Radiology and Medical Informatics, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland  \nPresenting Author email address: selima.zahar@epfl.ch  \nAbstract:  This study aimed to assess the time -on-task effect on load -related cortical activity using \nfunctional near infrare d spectroscopy. Thirty -six healthy adults completed Stroop and n -back tasks \nwith three cognitive load s across three runs. Findings revealed a time -on-task effect, marked by \nhigher subjective mental fatigue, as well as a strategic shift, with improved task accuracy rate and \nreduced cortical activity , particularly  in the frontal region. Further research with  higher statistical \npower is needed to determine if this shift involves automated processes in other cortical regions.  \nIntroduction: Research using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has shed light on how the brain copes \nwith cognitive load to s upport executive functions by allocating attention resources to frontal and parietal regions \n(1). However, there is a gap in understanding the impact of sustained attention, known as the time -on-task (ToT) \neffect, on the brain's coping mechanisms. This effect, characterized by increased mental fatigue, carries real -world \nconsequences such as an elevate d risk of work -related accidents (2). This study aims  to investigate  the ToT effect on \ncognitive load -related fNIRS signals and cognitive executive functions in healthy adults.  \nMethods: Thirty -six healthy adults aged 25 to 45 completed the n -back and Stroop tasks at three randomly assigned \nload levels  over three runs.  Primary measures included fNIRS data acquired using a 40 -channel continuous -wave \nsystem (Oxymon, Artinis Medical Systems, The Netherlands) at a sampling rate of 50Hz. The 10 -20 system was \nused to position a template of 3cm -channels over the frontal, p arietal, temporal left and right, and occipital regions. \nData processing involved motion artifact correction, conversion of optical density into oxygenated hemoglobin \nconcentration ([HbO] ) and  physiological noise  reduction  using a band -pass filter  ([0.01-0.55] Hz). General linear \nmodels were used to assess channel activation relative  to baseline for each subject, run, and load, with multiple \ncomparisons correction  using false discovery rate (p<0.1) . Secondary measures included task accuracy rate as well \nas subjective mental fatigue assessed using a visual analogue scale before and after each run. Linear mixed -effect \nmodels were applied to analyze main and interaction effects of run and load levels  on regional activation and \naccuracy rate, and to assess  the effect of run  level  on subjective mental fatigue.  \nResults: Throughout the runs, subjects  reported higher mental fatigue  level s. This \neffect was accompanied by a higher accuracy rate and reduced frontal and temporal \nright HbO during the Stroop task. Across the runs of the n-back task , higher  \naccuracy rate and lower load -induced rise in frontal HbO were observed  (Fig. 1). \nConclusion : This study suggest s a ToT effect accompanied by  a strategic shift, as \nindicated by fNIRS patterns of reduced controlled attention alongside improved \ncognitive executive functions. This pattern, particularly the reduced frontal \nactivity, was most noticeable under high load conditions in the n -back task, \nindicating increased challenges in sustaining attention. In the Stroop task, the \nreduced temporal activity suggested lower language processing of task -irrelevant \ninformation, i.e. the displayed word  (3). However, it remains unclear if attention \nresource reduction also affects parietal regions and if it involves a transition to \nautomated processing by posterior regions, such as the occipital region  (2). Further \nresearch with higher statistical power is needed to better understand the brain \nmechanisms involved in coping with sustained  workload. This knowledge can \ninform interventions to optimize cognitive and mental health  in real -world settings.  \nReferences:  1. Fishburn FA, Norr ME, Medvedev AV, Vaidya CJ.

Using theta -burst stimulation (TBS) applied to  the right vlPFC \nin a sample of 88 healthy participants, we investigated the psychological and (neuro -)physiological \nstress response. Preliminary analyses replicate previous findings on aberrant prefrontal functioning \nunder stress in high trait ruminators but show only weak effects of the neurostimulation on the \npsychological and physiological stress response.  \n \nIntroduction:  Studies have shown that rumination – a trans -diagnostic process of repetitive negative thoughts – plays \na crucial role in the stress -depression link. Social stress has been shown to induce state rumination in patients with \ndepressed and healthy subjects. Regarding the neural underpinnings, previous studies have shown that the increase in \nstate rumination after social stress is mediated by reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex during the stress induction. \nHowever, only few studies directly investigated the role of the prefrontal cortex in the stress -rumination link. Using \nTBS as a noninvasive approach to manipulate brain activity, we aimed to investigate the effects of different protocols \non state rumination in a clinical analogous sample to confirm a pivotal role of prefrontal areas in (the cognitive control \nof) stress -induced rumination. So far, one study applied intermittent TBS (iT BS) to the left DLPFC following the Trier \nSocial Stress Test (TSST) on the stress response and stress -reactive rumination (De Witte et al., 2020) in 40 subjects. \nTheir results showed a marginally significant buffering effect on increases in state ruminatio n in high trait ruminators \nas a consequence of the iTBS. Further studies using larger sample sizes and assessing neurophysiological data are \nneeded to disentangle the associations of prefrontal functioning in the stress -rumination link.  \n \nMethods: In this study, we recruited a stratified sample of 88 healthy subjects (44 low and 44 high trait ruminators) \nwho received either a continuous TBS (cTBS, i.e. inhibitory), iTBS (i.e. excitatory) or sham TBS applied to the right \nvlPFC prior to a stress induction usi ng the TSST. Throughout the experiment, we assessed subjective stress, state \nrumination and affect ratings, heart rates and prefrontal cortical oxygenation using functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy.  \n \nResults: Preliminary results show a successful stress  induction and corresponding neural activation patterns \nreplicating previous findings but only weak effects of the neurostimulation on a behavioral (subjective stress, state \nrumination, affect), physiological (heart rates) or neural level (cortical oxygena tion). We observed higher increases in \nsubjective stress, state rumination and negative affect in the case of higher trait rumination levels. Further, high \nruminators showed less pronounced increases in cortical oxygenation due to the stress induction. Fin al results will be \npresented at the conference.  \n \nConclusion:  We interpret the aforementioned findings in the light of expectancy effects as well as a potential \nvanishing of TBS effects in the case of a strong experimentally induced hemodynamic response. P ractical implications \nfor future studies will be discussed.  \n \nReferences:  \nDe Witte, S., Baeken, C., Pulopulos, M. M., Josephy, H., Schiettecatte, J., Anckaert, E., ... & Vanderhasselt, M.

Orihuela -Espinaa \n \naSchool of Computer Science , University of Birmingham, United Kingdom ,  \nPresenting Author email address: rjw207@student.bham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Colourations Maps offer a look-up table solution to inverse  problems . Their \nreconstruction error is limited by the entries in the table in turn limited by computational demands . \nCrust & Crumb, a pseudo -random gradient -weighted sampling design is put forward aiming to \nescape the combinatorial explosion  of traditional sampling designs  whilst keeping the reconstruction \nerror at bay.  A synthetic exponential model alike the Beer -Lambert law is constructed to establish \nthe validity of the new sampling design, and a finite element diffusion model exemplifies its \nfeasibility against spectroscopic data.  In experiments, Crust and Crumb exhibited superior \nperformance over alternatives.  \n \nIntroduction:  One method for parameter recovery in spectroscopic applications are colouration maps (CMs).  A CM \nis a precalculated lookup table resulting from light transport through matter  accompanied by interpolated \nreconstruction of intermediate entries . Despite huge advances in image reconstruction, CMs remain a competitive \nmethod provid ing virtually immediate  solutions to the inverse problem with arbitrary low error hence  enabl ing scalable \nportable platforms [1]. In applications like broadband near -infrared spectroscopy (bNIRS), such scalability  is essential \nfor real -time imaging advancements . For instance, despite their utter simplicity, CMs can rival modern deep learning \nmethods in efficiency and scalability whilst offering  clearer interpretability of their known assumptions.  The key to \nsuch efficiency is that the computational cost of generating the CM is paid upfront. Crucial to minimiz ing the \nreconstruction error  as well as the generating cost is the sampling design , a problem  influenced by the space geometry, \nthe interpolation method s and the forward generation  cost[2]. We propose Crust & Crumb  (CC) , a new solution to the \nsampling design problem  with applications to sampling the B eer-Lambert law within  fNIRS . \nMethods: The full methodology and pseudocode can be found in Ward 2024 [3]. In brief , CC is a pseudo -random \ngradient weighted sampling design (the Crumb), with defined parameter boundaries (the Crust). The Crust is \nestablished via hulling to a desired convexity or concavity.  The inner space is sampled by weighting a random sample \ninversely proportional to the absolute gradient of the forward model.  Redundancy  is reduced by enforcing a ‘bubble’ \naround each point, in which no other point may be generated.   \nResults: Simulations were enacted on a rectangular  mesh within \nNIRFAST , for a source and detector with 25mm separation. For \nvalidation, only a reduced number of wavelengths (three) are used. \nThe concentration of O2Hb was varied from 20 to 100 𝜇𝑀. CMs of 3 -\n6 points along the O2Hb distribution were generated via CC, gridded, \ngradient based and random sampling  and used to interpolate 500 \nuniformly distributed O2Hb values via radial basis function \ninterpolation with a 1% perturbation.  CC exhibited superior overall \nperformance (Fig 1) and further exhibiting faster convergence (i.e. \nbetter leveraging sparser sampling), and scalability to higher \ndimensions (i.e. more parameters or wavelengths) . In contrast, \nrandom sampling  perform ed the wors e (Mixed -Effects ANOVA: p = \n0.025), with pairwise random sampling comparisons echo ing this \n(Bonferoni posthoc: Random - Grid-like/Gradient/Crust Crumb: p < \n0.05) . \nConclusion:  We have proposed and validated CC sampling design, offering computational affordability and \nscalability. Future work involves the generation of CMs for specific tissues and further validation against phantoms.  \nReferences : \n[1] R. A. Stillwell, V. J. Kitsmiller, A. Y. Wei, A. Chong, L. Senn, and T.

    "Full model selection of the fNIRS pipeline  \n \nR. J. Warda, R. Mesquitaa, J. Andreu-Perezb, F. Orihuela -Espinaa \n \naSchool of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom , \nbCentre for Computational Intelligence, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex , United Kingdom , \nPresenting Author email address: rjw207@student.bham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Most literature do not report to objectively measure the quality of pipelines. However, \nobjectively measuring the pipeline quality is viable, and consequently , that same objective measure \nof quality can be exploited for optimization. Here we present what we believe to be the first attempt \nat full model optimization for fNIRS processing and analysis pipeline.  We present both a toy \nsynthetic example validating the approach as well as an exemplification in fNIRS using the vanilla \nHomer 3 functions. Our results suggest that objective optimization of the pipeline is a feasible \nendeavour, with implications for both  quality but also automation of research.   \n \nIntroduction:  Despite recent efforts, there is no such a thing as a standard processing and analysis pipeline i n \nfNIRS[1] , with each group applying some operations  and ad -hoc parameterization  based on expertise and careful \nconsideration, or, blindly setting a “one-size-fits all ” recipe. If we could  objectively measure the quality of a pipeline, \nthen that objective endpoint can also be used for optimization. Receiver operator curve analysis (ROC) has already \nbeen used previousl y[2] as a measure of quality of a pipeline.  Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is one method by \nwhich  to optimise  over a discrete, non -dense space in which  a neighbourhood of solutions is not defined by Euclidian \ngeometry. This description fits the typical fNIRS pipeline: a number of pre -defined functions applied in specific order, \nfor which the final convolution of functions transforms a dataset to a  physiological reconstruction or activation \nidentifier. This is a problem  referred to as  full model selection (FMS) [3]. \nMethods:  We present validation of the approach over a synthetic toy example as well as  an exemplification in fNIRS \nusing Homer 3 functions and a preexisting dataset that we have analysed[4]. For the toy example, we define each  \nparticle contain ing a finite partially ordered set of  𝑛 elements (e.g. functions) . Each element may appear at most once \nin a particle . We also define the structural algebra by allowing a n element to be added or removed from the set, with \nthe remaining elements maintaining their ordering.  An illustration of potential sets and their relations can be seen in \nFig. 1 . The mode of three movement vectors controls the movement of \nparticle s within this space : a random movement vector, the global minimum \nof the particle  set, and the particle’s local minima.  Finally, some na ive cost \nfunction , e.g. cardinality of the set,  suffices to verify the dynamics of the \nparticle swarm converging to the global minima.  To introduce the \napplication domain each numerical identifier maps to a Homer3 toolbox \nfunction, and ROC score[2] was used as cost function.  \nResults: Our toy model reinforces  that a set of particles can  find the minima \nof the tested cost functions . The application to fNIRS  pipelines involves the \nwrapping of functions to the numerical identifiers and introducing our \nrelevant cost function.  The average quality of the pipelines particle swarm \nas a function of the iterations of the optimization process suggest that we \nare succeeding in optimizing the fNIRS pipeline at channel level.  \nConclusion:  We have provided evidence that optimizing the processing and \nanalysis pipeline  of fNIRS data is feasible at individual channel level. \nFuture work involves extending the idea to full neuroimages or groups of \nthem as well as  refining the constraints criteria and exploring alternative quality cost functions.  This works has \nimplications for fNIRS research quality and automation of science.  \nReferences : \n[1] Yücel, M. A . et al. , Neurophotonics , 8(01), 2021.  \n[2] H. Santosa, X. Zhai, F.

By  \nsimultaneous ly monitoring neural activity and hemodynamics in the neocortex, we investigate d \nneurovascular coupling  during this activity . Neuronal active periods  of this cortical activity  resulted \nin consequent rise in cerebra l blood flow , which was  quantified through group analysis and \nhemodynamic response function generation.  It was further assessed through  direct electrical \nstimulation in the brain cortex . \n \nIntroduction : Slow wave activity (SWA) is a low frequency cortical activity observed during non -repetitive eye \nmovement sleep or deep anesthesia , as alternate active and silent periods of electrical activity [1,2]. Its study can aid \nto comprehend  complex brain function ing as well as address a number of neurological conditions. Neurovascular \ncoupling being a fundamental brain characteristic, its investigation during this activity is, undoubtedly, important.  \nMethods: Experiments were carried out in anesthetized male C57B L/6J mice (N =10). Relative cerebral blood flow \n(rCBF) using laser speckle flowmetry and surface local field potential (LFP) using a 32 -channel multielectrode array \nwere simultaneously monitored  during both unperturbed  and electrically perturbed  SWA.  \nResults: As summarized in figure 1, rise in rCBF is observed as a response to active state of SWA which was \nquantified through group analysis and hemodynamic response function (HRF)  generation . Electrical perturbation in \nthe cortex helped in further exploring t he spatial aspects of the LFP -rCBF responses across the cortical hemisphere . \n \nConclusion : Neurovascular coupling during SWA was carefully investigated through experiments in mice, which \nprovided valuable insights into the spatiotemporal aspects of rCBF -LFP relationships.  \nReferences : [1] Steriade, M. et al 1993.

Our ongoing \nstudy will answer this question by measuring biobehavioral synchrony  (BBS)  by means of  \nfunctional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning during parent -child gameplay before \nand after a stressful parent conflict discussion (N=60 families, children’s age 4 -8 years). Preliminary \nresults, to be available at the conference, are expected to show stronger BBS during the first versus \nthe second gameplay session  due to the spillover effects of negative emotions. Understanding the \nmechanisms of BBS can inform interventions to improve well-being and promote healthier family \nrelationships.  \n \nIntroduction:  Biobehavioral synchrony (BBS) arises  when signals from two or more agents become  aligned  during \nsocial interaction s at the ir behavioral, physiological, and neuronal level(s).1 A growing number of studies have shown \nthat BBS is important for social processes (e.g., cooperation tasks), communication, empathy, and \nattachment/bonding.2 Yet, the factors that influence BBS during social interactions remain poorly understood. This \nstudy aims to investigate how emotional states and attachment relate to BBS during parent -child social interaction s, \nand how resilient this association is after parents undergo a stressful conflict by discussing a major issue in their \nmarriage.  \nMethods: The study will recruit families (mother -father -child triad) with young children (4 -8 years old) and have \nthem engage in a cooperative family activity (i.e. , building a Jenga tower) . They will play twice, before and after a \nconflict discussion where parents will discuss an area of conflict within their marriage. During these tasks, we will \nuse fNIRS hyperscanning to measure brain activity from two brain areas (dlPFC and TPJ) with four channels per \nregion in both parents and derive interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) through Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC) \nanalysis.3 Additionally, both parents will self -report their attachment style and relationship quality and provide \nemotional ratings when reviewing their video -recorded interactions.   \nResults: Preliminary results will be available at the conference as we anticipate acquiring data over the summer. We \npredict BBS to be stronger during family gameplay facilitating positive emotions, collaboration, and empathy between \nfamily members. In contrast, BBS during the second gameplay is anticipated to decrease due to the spillover effects \nof negative emotions during the parent conflict  discussion. Overall, it is expected that couples with more secure \nattachments and better relationship quality will have higher BBS during social interaction since those couples tend to \nbe more effective at regulating their emotions and resolving conflict , which may in turn facilitate stronger BBS during \nsocial interaction. It is also expected that BBS between  the parents will rise in the intervals when they both report \nsimilar emotions.  \nConclusion: We hope that the obtained findings will help better understand the underlying mechanism of BBS for \nsocial communication and interaction, attachment, and bonding, and support the development of new interventions to \nimprove well-being and family health. Understanding the impact of negative discussions on family members and the \npotential spillover effects can contribute to the development of interventions and strategies for promoting healthier \nfamily relationships and overall well -being.  \n1.

However,  the neural \nmechanisms underlying very early rhythm encoding remain poorly understood. We present \npreliminary results of o ur ongoing study  with High-Density functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy  \nin premature newborns , to explore cortical activation specificity to rhythmic versus arrhythmic \nauditory stimuli. Neurovascular coupling, previously documented in premature infants, was \nobserved bilaterally across temporal, frontal, and parietal regions, with heightened HbO res ponse to \nrhythmic stimuli. These findin gs underscore early cortical engagement in rhythm processing.  \n \nIntroduction:  Rhythm perception is of fundamental importance , for the development of multiple cognitive capacities . \nLittle is known about the underlying mechanisms  of neural rhythm encoding during early development.  Using EEG, \nwe have recently shown  that the premature  brain  detects violations of rhythmic regularities  and code s the rhythmic \nhierarchy of a n auditory sequence . The objective  of th e current  study was to  investigate  cortical region activation \nspecificity in response to rhythmic versus arrhythmic auditory stimulation. .  \nMethods:  In an still ongoing study, High Density functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (HD fNIRS) was conducted \nin 9 premature newborns  (34-36 wGA) using  a multi -distance fNIRS  setup  (Imagent ; ISS , 8 detectors and 10 emitters  \non each hemisphere ) during exposure to rhythmic and arrhythmic auditory sequences (controlled for acoustic \ncharacteristics) at different tempi, in a block design paradigm . Signals intensities were converted to Hb/HbO \nconcentrations. After preprocessing,  the responses to  each stimulus condition were averaged over blocks, for each \nparticipant and over each channel  (sensitivity profile of the pro be shown in the Figure). A 3s window around the peak \nof the Hb O curve was selected for s tatistical analyses , comparing the two conditions over all tempi.   \nResults: The neurovascular coupling ( HbO increased and Hb decreased ), already  described in premature newborns, \nwas observed across  both r hythmic and arrhythmic conditions , over both hemispheres and  over different brain regions, \nincluding temporal , frontal and parietal cortical  areas . The average HbO response to both conditions peaked at  ∼10 s \nafter the stimulus onset. Statistical analysis revealed a significantly larger HbO response to the rhythmic condition \ncompared to the arrhythmic condition (Figure 1). A rightward lateralization was observed , although further \nconfirmation is required upon completion of the recordings.   \nConclusion:  Our results demonstrate \ndifferent activation of temporal, frontal and \nparietal regions in response to r hythmic and \narrhythmic seque nces. These findings  \nsuggest an early and specific involvement of \ncortical circuits in encoding rhythmic \nperiodicity. Our ongoing fNIRS recordings \naim to provide a more detailed \nunderstanding of  the spatial representation \nof neurovascular coupling in response to \nrhythmic characteristics of sound.  \nAcknowledgments : This project has \nreceived funding from the European \nUnion’s Horizon 2020 research and \ninnovation program under grant agreement no 101017113 .

To match  the growing number  \nof its potential applications  and the different project needs , we have designed a  configurable  \nSCOS/SCOT hardware module  that can readily be stacked for multi -channel use and hybridized \nwith other modalities.  An internal computation unit and a  software suite are provided for the  \nprocessing , transfer , and display of  the data , cloud computing is utilized for  data storage, and \nredundant smart systems are deployed for laser safety . \n \nIntroduction:  Supported by recent publications addressing  some of the main  theoretical and technological aspects of \nits implementation  [1,2], s peckle contrast optical spectroscopy/tomography (SCOS/SCOT) has gained interest  for \nbeing  an inexpensive , portable method for non -invasive optical monitoring of deep -tissue microvascular blood flow. \nAs SCOS is becoming more commonplace, the need for hybrid (e.g., combining with near -infrared spectroscopy  – \nNIRS) and/or multi -channel systems is rising. To tha t end, we have developed and characterized a multi -purpose , \nversatile  module  covering a broad range of applications  that can benefit from blood flow monitoring , together with \nthe software needed to manage the data from  the acquisition of  speckle pattern s to the display of  noise/artifact -\ncorrect ed blood flow changes . \nSystem description : Figure 1 reports a diagram of the \nSCOS/SCOT  module in the context of a generic data \nacquisition system .

An \ninternal  single -board computer processes the  captured  \nimages  and prov ides an output  data stream  that includes  real-\ntime blood flow indices  and quality metrics on th e reliability \nof the  measurement  (sample rate up to  40 Hz , generally  suitable for cardiac pulsatility  analysis ).

A randomiz ed, \ndouble -blind, placebo -controlled crossover  study was conducted using functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy  (fNIRS) , cognitive tasks, heart rate variability analysis and psychological \nquestionnaire s. The main results showed significant improvem ents in the accuracy of an attention  \ntask and prefrontal activity during a working memory task following the intake of glucose Ramune \ncandy. In addition, scores on the Energetic Arousal+ and Vitality -Activity scales increased in the \nglucose condition. These result s suggest that glucose Ramune cand ies may improve mood, brain \nactivity and attention.  \n \nIntroduction:  Glucose is the primary energy source for the healthy human brain . While the need for glucose as an \nenergy source in the brain and the importance of its supply are undisputed, the acute effects of glucose intake on brain \nfunction remain unclear.  A previous research  has shown  that consuming glucose , especially when ingested as a candy \nrich in glucose called  glucose Ramune  candy,  enhanc es cognitive function  such as working memory and sustaining \nattention  [1]. Moreover, a systematic review of neuroimaging studies related to the effects of glucose on cognition \nsuggested that there are specific brain regions in the medial temporal and frontal lobes and networks that are sensitive \nto increased peripheral blood glucose levels  [2]. However,  the amount of glucose intake, participants, cognitive tasks, \nand testing methods are not uniform, and the small number of studies leaves much unknown.  This study uses functional \nnear-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), cognitive tasks, heart rate variability analysis and psychological questionnaires \nin a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled crossover test with healthy young adults to investigate the basic \neffect s of glucose intake on psychophysio logical status . \n \nMethods: In 22 healthy young adults, we studied the double -blind crossover trials comparing placebo  candy \n(controlled candy without  glucose ) and glucose  Ramune candy. We measured cortical activation during  working \nmemory and flanker tasks using fNIRS  (ETG -4000, Hitachi) . Autonomic nervous activity was also monitored using \nelectrocardiograms before and after these tasks. In addition, p hysiological states were assessed  using the Emotional \nArousal and Alertness Checklist (EACL), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and a visual analog ue scale.  These \nmeasurements were taken before ingestion  and 30 minutes after ingestion.  \n \nResults: In the psychological asses sment, the energetic arousal+ score on the EACL and the vigor -activity scale score \non the POMS were significantly increased after in gestion of the glucose Ramune candy. In addition, the accuracy of \nthe flanker task improved significantly and an increase in oxy -Hb sig nals was found in the right temporal area. \nPrefrontal activation during the working memory task increased in the glucose Ram une candy condition , while there \nwas no difference in performance between the conditions.  \n \nConclusion:  These result s suggest that co nsuming glucose Ramune candy has a positive effect on mood, brain activity, \nand attention.  \n \n1) Inagaki H , Yamamoto  T, Shimoma  S, Mori  S, Morita M, Ito A et al. .

We \nhave conducted the first ever demonstration of whole -head HD -DOT for infant neuroimaging , and \nthese analysis approaches will form the basis of future applications of infant whole -head HD -DOT.  \n \nIntroduction:  Infancy is a time of rapid brain development . Recent years have seen huge advances in wearable hardware \nfor high -density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT), but p revious HD -DOT headgear has only been capable of \nsampling specific areas of the cortex . Having  develop ed headgear capable of sampling across the whole infant scalp \nsurface  (Figure 1A.), we aimed to collect whole -head HD -DOT data from infants presented with an audio -visual \nparadigm of social and non -social stimuli (Fig ure 1B.) and explore different statistical approaches to analysing the data.  \nMethods:  We developed a whole -head infant implementation of the high -density LUMO design developed by \nGowerlabs Ltd. (UK). In our prototype, 33 LUMO modules ( total 99 sources and 132 detectors) were embedded in a \nneoprene cap. HD -DOT data were collected from infants aged 5 - to 7-months (N=24) during the presentation of a screen -\nbased paradigm alternating social and non -social sounds and images (Figure 1B.). Time -series images were reconstructed \nfor each individual mapping changes in oxy - ([HbO]) and deoxy -haemoglobin ([HbR]) concentrations. In a first analysis \napproach, general linear modelling ( GLM ) was taken  to model responses , convolving a canonical haemodynamic \nresponse function (HRF) with stimulus onsets to produce a design matrix . In another approach, we block -averaged  and \nbaseline corrected  data from  -2s to 20s post -stimulus onset.  \nResults: Our final sample included valid data from N=16 \nparticipants. For both conditions  and for both analysis \napproaches , increased  t-statistic values (Figure  1C. and 1D. ) \nfor changes in [HbO] can be seen bilaterally in the superior \ntemporal sulcus -temporoparietal junction (STS -TPJ) region \nand occipitally . Functional responses in the inferior frontal \ngyrus are seen, and inverted responses (i.e. decreased [HbO]) \nare seen in the pre - and post -central gyri.  Qualitatively, there is \na high -level of agreement between the activation images \nobtained with the two approaches. Key differences  were much \nlower  t -statistic values and slightly lower area of the cortex  \ncovered by significant changes in the GLM maps . \nConclusion:  This is the first demonstration of whole -head HD -\nDOT in infants. We have mapped activity in regions across the \nentire cortex : in the STS -TPJ region our results are consistent \nwith findings in previous infant research , while we also \nmapped  regions outside the STS -TPJ that typically have not \nbeen sampled in previous infant optical neuroimaging research of social processing.

This study  investigates brain -to-brain synchrony  between preschoolers and \nmothers,  and the effect of short channels regression on its computation. We also implement a phase -\nscrambled pseudo dyad analysis to better understand  the origin s of brain -to-brain synchrony. After \nphysiological noise reduction , the alignment of  children and parents’ functional brain activity  \nappears robust and related to dynamics of real interaction , particularly in deoxygenated \nhaemoglobin .  \n \nIntroduction:  Neural synchrony, the alignment of neural activity between two \nindividuals, is a commonly proposed mechanism that could underlie coordinated \nsocial exchanges . Research suggests  that neural synchrony may be elicited \nduring children ’s interactions ; however, there is a lack of standardization in data \nanalysis pipelines . This study aimed to integrate new approaches for processing \ndevelopmental fNIRS hyperscanning data  to reduc e physiological noise and test \nthe role of environment -related frequency alignment using phase -scrambled \npseudo dyad analysis .  \n \nMethods: Data from N = 49 dyads of mothers and their four - to six -year-old children \n(27 males, age M ± SD = 5.12 ± 0.86 years ) were collected at Birkbeck’s ToddlerLab.  \nWhilst solving Tangram puzzles  in collaborative and individual conditions , \nparticipants wore a Brite MKII  syste m (760 and 850 nm , Artinis Medical Systems BV, \nThe Netherlands)  with channels  over bilateral prefrontal cortices and temporoparietal \njunctions. Homer2  [1] was used to wavelet -correct m otion artefacts (iqr=1.5 mothers, \n0.8 children) , remove high-frequency noise and slow drift ( band -pass filter, order, \nthird; frequency range ([0.01 0.5] Hz ) [2], and convert optical density signals into \nconcentration changes in oxygenated (HbO 2) and deoxygenated (HbR) haemoglobin \nusing the modified Beer -Lambert law (DPF=[5.4 4.7] children, [6 6] mothers) [ 3]. Short-separation channel  \nsignals  were used to minimize the  impact of scalp  blood flow on brain activity estimation . Neural synchrony \nwas calculated as wavelet transform coherence in true and phase -scrambled pseudo dyads  (see figure) [4].  \n \nResults: Extracerebral noise regression  significantly reduced  average coherence  strength , particularly in \nHbO 2, but coherence  in both HbO 2 and HbR  after correction was stronger in collaborative than individual \nconditions . Coherence in both HbO 2 and HbR was significantly stronger in true than in phase -scrambled pseudo \ndyads, though  alignment in  HbR seemed  more reliably related to the temporal dynamics of true interaction  than HbO 2.  \n \nConclusion:  Neural  coherence, particularly in HbO 2, may be artificially inflated by the alignment  of extracerebral \nsignal s. Research should endeavour  to reduce the impact of physiological noise on estimation of brain activity using \ntechniques like  short -separation channel regression . Overall , coherence during children’s interactions appears robust \nand related to  the coordination of cortical haemodynamic  activity  during online social interaction .  \n \nReferences: [1] Huppert et al., 2009 , Applied Optics ; [2] Nguyen et al., 2020, Cortex ; [3] Scholkmann & Wolf, 2013, \nJournal of Biomedical Optics ; [4] Simony et al., 2016, Nature Communications .  \n213 of 398",

The power spectrum \ndensity for the concentrations of oxy - and deoxy - hemoglobin was calculated for both the intra - and \nextra - cerebral compartment of the frontal cortex. Spontaneous oscillations were found for the low \nand very low frequency ranges and also for  frequencies lower than 0.01 Hz.  \n \nIntroduction:  Spontaneous  ongoing global activity of the brain can be addressed as  resting state1. Continuous -wave \n(CW)  functional near infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS)  was already employed in these studies  showing interesting \npotentiality2. Recently we demonstrated that, thanks to some technological advancements, also in the time -domain \n(TD) regime3 it is possible to perform measurements with a sufficient acquisition rate for resting -state studies , allowing  \nfor a depth discrimination with a single channel . The purp ose of this work is to show the results of an in -vivo \nmeasurement campaign on resting state oscillations . We will  present the power spectrum density (PSD) of t he \nsuperficial signal (systemic , UP) and of the brain cortex (DW) for oxy - (O2Hb) and deoxy - (HHb) hemoglobin.  \nMethods:  TD fNIRS acquisition s were performed on the frontal cortex of 16 healthy volunteer s (20 Hz acquisition \nrate, 4 cm interfiber dist ance, 15 min , subject supine , backrest tilted at 30 °, eye closed ). Blood volume pulse  (BVP)  \nwas acquired to have a reference for the systemic oscillations.  The photon mean pathlengths in a two -layer medium \nwere calculated and used to estimate the absolute values for O2Hb and HHb concentrations , UP and DW4. PSD of all \nparameters  was obtained with a Welch algorithm  (Hamming windows : 3-min length, overlapping factor : 0.5). \nResults: In Fig. 1, the average normalized PSD for O 2Hb_UP and  O2Hb_DW (a , b), HHb_UP and HHb_DW ( c, d) \nare shown.  In Fig s. 1a and 1c the low (LF: 0.06 -0.15) and very low (VLF: 0.01 -0.06) frequenc ies are reported ; in Fi gs. \n1b and 1d the frequencies for the heart beat  are shown; i n green the average BVP PSD.  We can almost observe the \nabsence of the LF oscillations for both cortical and systemic compartment, while discrete VLF oscillations  are present, \nwith some differences in both the region s and hemoglobin specimen s. The higher PSD is found for frequencies < 0.01 \nHz, where the endothelial activity is represented. The heart beat oscillations are visible only in the O 2Hb_UP  signal.  \nConclusion:  The PSD for O2Hb and HH b concentrations in the brain cortex  and systemic compartment  were retrieved \nwith a single source detector distance TD fNIRS measure ment  on a cohort of 16 subjects during resting state.

    "A framework  of sEMG-fNIRS feature selection  for brain-\ncontrolled lower -limb exoskeleton  \n \nRuisen Huang , Wenze Shang, and Fei Gao  \nShenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS , Nanshan, 518055 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China  \nfei.gao@siat.ac.cn  \n \nAbstract:  This study develops a signal processing framewo rk based on sEMG and fNIRS  for brain -\ncontrolled lower -limb exoskeleton . Using a delayed GLM, the Balloon model, and signal simulation \ntechniques, the framework identifies key feature pairs , mean -slope and mean -entropy , for real -time \nstate discrimination in lower -limb tasks , enhancing the understanding of the inter play between \ncerebral and muscular activities  for brain -controlled lower -limb exoskeletons .  \nIntroduction:  The brain -controlled lower -limb exoskeleton offers a promising rehabilitation solution for patients with \nneuromuscular impairments due to strokes or other conditions  [1]. This study explores the direct, real -time mapping \nof cerebral ac tivation patterns to muscular activities via processing  surface electromyographic  (sEMG ) and functional \nnear-infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS ) data. It aims to establish a viab le signal processing framework and identify \neffective feature pairs for real-time pattern recognition during sit -down and stand -up tasks.  \nMethods: Simultaneous fNIRS and sEMG data were collected from three healthy adults using the NirScan  (Danyang \nHuichuang, China)  and the Trigno Avanti  (Delsys  Incorporated, USA)  during a block -designed sit -down and stand -\nup paradigm. Optical intensities were transformed to differential optical densities (ΔOD), filtered with both low -pass \n(1 Hz) and high -pass (3.5 × 10-4 Hz) settings, and corrected for motion ar tifacts using regression on short -separation \nchannels. EMG data were segmented into 50 -sample windows, with activity levels determined by exceeding a set \nthreshold. The active muscular paradigm combined all significant muscle activities within the experime ntal tasks. \nHemodynamic responses modeled by the Balloon model were used as regressors in a general linear model (GLM), \nselecting delays that maximized β and t-values [2, 3] . Channels that consistently met significance ( p < 0.05) were used  \nto extract eight features over a 5 -second window. These features were then evaluated through a linear discriminant \nanalysis (LDA) classifier, trained with 10 -fold validation, using the first six trials for training and the last two for \ntesting. Classifica tion rates (CR) and true positive rates (TPRs) were averaged to determine optimal feature pairs.  \nResults: Classification rates involving  the feature mean were superior to other features. The mean -slope and mean -\nentropy pairs yielded comparable CR s of approximately 70%, outperforming mean -std, mean -kurtosis, and mean -\nskewness. Furthermore, mean -slope, mean -entropy, and slope -entropy pairs demonstrated high TPRs exceeding 90% \nfor dynamic tasks (sit down and stand up) but were less effective for stead y states (sitting and standing).    \nConclusion:  These preliminary findings validate a processing framework  that effectively maps cerebral activities to \nmuscular activations for real -time applications. Notably, the feature mean  emerges as critical for real -time state \nrecognition, while slope  and entropy  significantly enhance the identification of action -related states. Collectively, \nthese results advance the development of brain -controlled lower -limb exoskeletons, marking a significant step t owards \ntheir practical realization.  \nReferences:  1.

    "Unlocking unique reactions: Novel insights into four \ncerebral and systemic responses to colored light \n \n \nSarusan Jegatheeswarana, Hamoon Zohdia, Felix Scholkmanna,b and Ursula Wolfa \n \na Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland  \nb Neurophotonics and Biosignal Research Group, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Neonatology, University Hospital \nZurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland  \n \nPresenting Author email address: hamoon.zohdi@unibe.ch ; sarusan.jegatheeswaran@students.unibe.ch  \n \nAbstract:  In this case study , we investigat ed physiological responses to colored light exposure \n(CLE) using systemic physiology augmented functional near -infrared spectroscopy (SPA -fNIRS). \nFour subjects were exposed to blue and red light while performing a cognitive task. Physiological \nparameters , such as  cerebral hemodynamics , blood pressure, skin conductance  and respiration , were \nmonitored. Subjects exhibited unique response patterns: consistent responses regardless of light \ncolor ( pattern 1), minimal difference between light colors ( pattern 2), mirrored effects across \nparameters ( pattern 3), and divergent trends ( pattern 4). These findings underscore the individual \nvariability in response to CLE and emphasize the importance of considering the individual \nphysiological constitution in such studies.  \n \nIntroduction:  For several years, our research group has been systematically investigating how changes in cerebral \nhemodynamics as well as systemic physiology can be induced by colored light exposure (CLE). We have observed \nthat these physiological changes can be different between subjects for exactly the same CLE stimulus. In the present \ncase study, we report specific physiological reactivity patterns from four subjects.  \n \nMethods: This is a case study in which  four subjects were exposed to blue and red light while performing a 2 ‐back \ntask. We simultaneously measured changes in cerebral and systemic physiological parameters using the systemic \nphysiology augmented functional near -infrared spectroscopy (SPA -fNIRS) method . The  SPA-fNIRS method  included \noxygenated hemoglobin ([O 2Hb]) and deoxygenated hemoglobin ([HHb]) in the prefrontal cortex, mean arterial \npressure (MAP), end -tidal carbon dioxide (P ETCO 2), skin conductance (SC) , heart rate  (HR) and respiration rate (RR).  \n \nResults: We identified four distinct physiological reactivity patterns. Pattern 1:  In all aspects except MAP, the \nsubject's response to blue and red light remained consistent. (O 2Hb: r= 0.94, p < 0.001; HHb: r= 0.89, p < 0.001; \nPETCO 2: r= 0.78, p < 0.001; MAP: r= 0.10, p = 0.63; SC: r= 0.95, p < 0.001; RR: r= 0.88, p < 0.001). Pattern 2: \nSimilar to the previous case, there was no notable contrast between red and blue with respect to changes in cerebral \nhemodynamics (O 2Hb: r= 0.95, p < 0.001; HHb: r= 0.88, p < 0.001). Similar patterns were also detected for P ETCO 2 \n(r= 0.90, p < 0.001) and MAP ( r= 0.73, p < 0.001), whereas completely different patterns were found for SC ( r= 0.16, \np = 0.47). Surprisingly, an inverse correlation was found for  RR ( r= -0.70, p < 0.001). Pattern 3: Changes in most \nparameters exhibited mirrored effects. Where changes increased with blue light exposure, they decreased with red \nlight, and vice versa (O 2Hb: r= -0.55, p = 0.006; HHb: r= -0.88, p < 0.001; P ETCO 2: r= -0.52, p = 0.007; MAP: r= -\n0.41, p = 0.04). Consistent trends were observed for SC and RR (SC: r= 0.70, p = 0.006; RR: r= 0.74, p < 0.001). \nPattern 4: Mirror -like patterns were evident for O 2Hb and HHb (O 2Hb: r= -0.72, p < 0.001; HHb: r= -0.71, p < 0.001), \nsame patterns for P ETCO 2 (r= 0.98, p < 0.001) and RR ( r= 0.48, p = 0.02), and divergent trends for MAP ( r= -0.17, p \n= 0.41) and SC ( r= 0.32, p = 0.12).  \n \nConclusion:  In our analysis, we identified four subjects with specific physiological reactivity patterns to CLE. Our \nfindings are important for a better  understanding of  physiological changes after CLE and to show that the individual \nphysiological reactivity or physiological constitution must be taken into account.  \n216 of 398",

Montpellier, IMT Mines Alès, 700 avenue du Pic -Saint Loup, 34090 Mont pellier, France  \ncoralie.reveille@umontpellier.fr  \n \nAbstract: Psychological theories suppose that teamwork evolves over a task episode , but this \nhypothesis cannot be tested  using questionnaires . This study use d fNIRS hyperscanning methods to \nassess teamwork  by examin ing the temporal course of interbrain synchrony ( IBS) in the prefrontal \ncortex and temporoparietal junction over a 30 -minute  task in 40 dyads. Preliminary analyses, using \nlinear mixed models, show ed no increase in IBS, suggesting  that teamwork may evolve in a more \ncomplex and dynamic manner . \n \nIntroduction : Teamwork is a social interaction in which  two or more individuals  collaborate to reach a common goal . \nUnderstanding  teamwork during a task episode is critical for h igh functioning teams  (e.g. flight crew s, surgical  teams) . \nThe team compilation model [1] suggest s that team work  matures and progresses during a task episode, but th e \nevolution of the teamwork trajectory has never been verified , due to the limitations of the traditional psychological \ntools (i.e.  questionnaires).  \nAs inter-brain synchrony (IBS) , the degree of similarity between the brain activities of individuals, appears to be a \nrelevant measure of teamwork [2], t his study aim ed to examine the trajector ies of IBS during a teamwork task episode. \nWe hypothesi sed that IBS would increase  during a task episode.  \n \nMethods: 40 dyads (health y \nadults) were settled as shown in \nthe Figure 1. They were  asked to \ncomplete a 30 -minute  computer \ntask. The fNIRS hyperscanning \nwas used to record brain activity \nin six regions within the \nprefrontal cortex and the \ntemporoparietal junction . IBS \nwas quantified through wavelet \ntransform coherence. The low -\nfrequency range  (0.009 -0.08 Hz ) \nof oxyhaemoglobin  were \nselected, frequency averaged, and \ntime averaged within fifteen  non-overla pping windows  each 2 minutes . \nLinear mixed models with time as fixed effect, slope and intercept as random effect s for dyads  were built to test the \neffect of time on IBS.  \n \nPreliminary r esults: In the six brain regions, control analyses using per muted dyads confirm ed the appearance of \nIBS during teamwork . Results from the linear mixed model s showed no significant effect of time over the 30 -minute  \ntask.   \n \nConclusion : This study shows that  teamwork does not exhibit  a global incre ment  (nor decre ment ) over the course of \na task. It would therefore be desirable to consider other methods  to capture the more complex and dynamic trajectories \nof IBS  in teamwork .  \n \nReferences:  \n[1] Kozlowski, S. W. J., Gully, S.

    "Link between respiration  depth, hemodynamic responses \nand neural activity in awake, behaving non-human primates \nEmily Skog1, Deepa Issar1, Madison Grigg1, Matthew Smith1,2, and Jana Kainerstorfer1,2 \n    1Biomedical Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, P A 15213  \n2Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, P A 15213  \nAbstract:     The study of interoception allows us to better understand brain -body interactions   and \nhow they are modulated to maintain homeostasis  and shape behavior in different contexts .  Past \nstudies have shown that respiration changes correlate to changes in brain hemodynamics and neural \nactivity, however most of these studies are limited to resting state. We studied the relationship \nbetween hemodynamics, neural activity, and respiration in non-human primates performing a \ncognitive task using  near-infrared spectroscopy and intracortical neural recordings in visual cortex . \nWe found that the hemodynamic response to the task increased with respiration depth while the \nneuronal response decr eased with respiration depth, giving insight into how respiration and the brain \ninteract in healthy, behaving subjects .\nIntroduction:  Interoception refers to the ability to perceive and interpret internal bodily sensations . Our interactions \nwith the environment are greatly influenced by interoception, which enables us to calibrate and modify our bodies to \nfunction at their best.  For example, respiration changes not only maintain the body’s homeostasis, but also exert \ninfluences on the brain and its hemodynamics : resting state  human and non -human primate (NHP) studies  have shown \ncorrelations between variations in respiration  depth and rate , neural activity  and changes  in blood oxygen level -\ndependent (BOLD) responses1,2. Similarly, rodent and feline studies have found a relationship between respiration \nphase and rate with local field potentials ( LFPs ), specifically a higher correlation of respiration phase and gamma \nband power (60 -100 Hz) in the LFP3. This work was performed primarily in resting state, leaving the link between \nrespiration, hemodynamics, and neural activity much less understood in behaving animals.  \nMethods:  We trained 1 NHP to perform a fixation task  (26 sessions)  where the animal held its gaze at the center of \nthe screen until a target appeared, after which they were required to saccade to the target to receive a reward. Some of \nthese trials included a full field checkerboard stimulus in the beginning of the trial, while others only a g rey \nbackground. Simultaneously, we measured changes in hemodynamics on the right hemisphere of visual cortex using \nan Artinis PortaLite  (Elst, The Netherlands) for near-infrared spectroscopy  (NIRS) , neural activity from V1 and V4 \nusing two 64 -electrode Blackrock “Utah” array s (Salt Lake City, UT)  and respiration using a custom thermal probe . \nDuring the presentation of the stimulus, w ith NIRS  \nwe recorded changes in oxyhemoglobin ( ∆𝐻𝑏𝑂) \nand applied an elliptical filter between 0.05 and 0.2 \nHz to extract the hemodynamic responses, and from \nthe array s we extracted the  LFP envelope  and the \ngamma band envelope of the LFP , to then correlate \nthis to changes in inspiration depth  (quantified  by \ntaking the prominence of the respiration signal ).  \nResults: Our data show ed a clear increase of ∆𝐻𝑏𝑂 \nafter stimulus presentation when the respiration \ndepth was higher . Inversely, the  LFP tended to  \ndecrease when the respiration depth increased after \nstimulus presentation. For both ∆𝐻𝑏𝑂 and LFP we \nextracted the highest value for all respiration depths \nand computed the c oefficient of determination  \nbetween the signal and the respiration depth \npercentile . The increase of  ∆𝐻𝑏𝑂 to the respiration \ndepth was statistically significant: R2=0.86, with a p-value of 0.0001 . Changes in the LFP were frequency -dependent, \nwith gamma amplitude  showing overall decreases when inspiration depth was higher.  \nReferences:  1Thomason M. & Glover G.

Boas2 \n1School of Computer Science,  College of  Engineering and Physical Science s, University of Birmingham , UK,  \n2Neurophotonics Center, Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, USA , 3Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , Stanford \nUniversity, USA , 4Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University, USA , Presenting author: s.montero@bham.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  We present a  new method for the extraction of  the default mode and dorsal attention networks using  \nresting state and task -based whole -head fNIRS data.  Results showed robust t est-retest reliability , high positive intra-\nnetwork  and negative inter -network  correlation s. \nIntroduction : The modulation of a ttention has been studied  as a biomarker for brain health  [1]. Attentional processes \nare encoded by a constant competition between the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks  \nexpressed by the extent of  DMN and DAN anti-correlat ion. Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a \nvaluable avenue for studying attention modulation dynamics in real -world settings, providing insights into the \ninterplay DMN  and DAN.  \nMethods:  Using  a  sparse whole -head fNIRS  device  (186-channel NIRx Sport system ), we collected  two 15-min \nresting state ( RS), and eight 2-back visual  working memory (WM)  runs from 15 and 3 subjects, respectively.  Raw \nintensities  were converted to optical density  (OD) , corrected for motion artifacts (SplineSG)  and projected into image \nspace using DOT principles.  DOT images were  band -pass filtered and underwent global signal regression. Schaefer \nparcel lation was  used to select the initial set of regions overlapping the DMN and DAN Yeo maps [ 2,3]. According to \nour probe sensitivity , we selected  8 and 2 parcels for DMN and DAN, respectively. Hierarchical clustering and \ncorrelation analysis were u sed to identify  DMN and DAN clusters exhibiting  high inter -ROI correlation. DAN clusters  \nselection  was further optimized based on their anti -correlation with DMN. Finally , a test-retest reliability and \ncondition -based contrast analys es were performed  for RS and WM data , respectively . Analysis was conducted  using \nHomer3  and AtlasViewer  functions  as well as customized MATLAB  scripts . Analyses were conducted on HbO data . \n \nFigure 1. Resting state reliability and working memory task functional connectivity analyses  on HbO . For RS data, DMN (first \neight rows/columns) and DAN (last two rows/column) regions  exhibit positive and negative patterns for intra - and inter -networks  \ncorrelation, respectively. In WM data, stronger anti -correlation between DMN and DAN  was found for active blocks  for subject  1 \nand 2 . \nResults and conclusions:  Test-retest reliability analys is demonstrated good  correspondence  of extracted networks  at \nthe group level  (Fig. 1 , Resting state) .

    "An augment ed reality guided optode positioning system  \non a head-mounted display device \n \nHiroshi Kawaguchi \n \nHuman Informatics and Interaction Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST),                 \nCentral 2, 1 -1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, 305 -8568, Japan.   \nhiroshi.kawaguchi@aist.go.jp  \n \nAbstract:  The optode positioning system using augmented reality  (AR) was implemented in a head -\nmounted display (HMD ) device . The system provides an AR representation of computer graphics \n(CGs) such as a brain structure  and position al indicator s just above the brain region s of interest \n(ROIs ) in virtual space, superimposed on the subject's head in real spac e. The operator wearing the \nHMD device can attach the optodes to the subject using both hands freely while checking the \nlocation of the ROI s with the CG s. In the preliminary experiment  with the head mannequin, it took \napproximately 3 minutes from system launch to completion of the optode attachment.  \n \nIntroduction:  For the precise measurement of hemodynamic  responses to neural activity  and oxygen metabolic  \nfunction  in a certain cortical region -of-interest ( ROI) using near -infrared sp ectrosco py (NIRS ), the pair of irradiation \nand detection optode s should be attached to the position on the scalp directly above the ROI. An augmented reality \n(AR) guided optode positioning system, which superimposes computer graphics on the subject's head in real space, \ninstructs the ROI location at the time the NIRS optode is attached [1].  In this study, an AR -guided positioning system \nwas implemented on a head -mounted display  (HMD ) device and its operability was demonstrated.    \n \nMethods: The positioning system was implemented in HoloLens 2 (Microsoft).  When an operator wearing Hololens \n2 activates the system in front of the subject, a transformation matrix that matches the facial landmarks in each of the \n2D image measured by the RGB camera and the pre -acquired 3D anatomical image is obtained in real time.  The \ntransformation matrix is applied to the brain structure in anatomical image space and displayed as a computer graphics, \nallowing the location of the ROI to be visualized as augmented reality on the subject's head , automatically . Depth \nsensor data was used to modify the CG position in the anterior and posterior directions. In addition, the system can \nmanually adjust the position of the CG by translating and rotating through virtual buttons and sliders . \n \nResults: The operability of the positioning system was \nevaluated using the head mannequin  (Fig. 1). Once the \nsystem was launched, it automatically aligned the CG \nof the brain structure and the arrows pointing directly \nover the primary motor cortex  (Fig. 1 (a1)). The \nposition was then slightly corrected by rigid body \ntransformation with reference to spherical CGs \nshowing the facial landmark position s (Fig. 1 (a2)). \nFinally , The optodes were attached to the mannequin \nhead using the CG position as a reference  (Fig. 1 (a3) \nand ( b)). The time from system launch to optode \nattachment was approximately 3 minutes.  \n \nConclusion:  By using the AR-guided positioning \nsystem implemented in the HMD  device , it was \ndemonstrated that the operator alone can attach the \noptodes in a short time while identifying the ROI \nlocation.   \n \nReference \n1.

Prefrontal cortex activity was evaluated during navigated walking tasks with fNIRS \nin 49 healthy older adults and 42 people with Parkinson's disease. Data was also collected with \ninertial measurement units, clinical tests, and with a neuropsychological test battery. Data analysis \nused general linear models and mixed -effects models. Prefrontal activity was more connected to \nexecutive ability in older adults and more connected to balance in people with Parkinson's disease.  \n \nIntroduction:  Complex walking tasks such as walking while talking, turning, and navigating around obstacles are \ncommon  in everyday life. People with Parkinson's disease  (PD)  have impairments in gait which are especially \npronounced during turning and when combined with a simultaneous task. With the impairments , gait is thought to be \nshifted towards voluntary control, with more activity in cortical structures. With  fNIRS,  activation in areas such as \nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)  can be measured during overground walking. Understanding how complex \nwalking performance relates to prefrontal activity can improve our understanding of disease -specific impairments.  \nTherefore, the aim of this study was to explore differences in prefrontal brain activity in older adults and people with \nPD during a navigational walking task and how they relate to factors such as balance and executive ability.  \n \nMethods: This exploratory study involved 49 older adults (OA) (60 -85 years, mean 69.3) and 42 and people with PD \n(60-91 years, mean 69.3, clinical diagnosis ≥ 6 months prior to enrolment). Participants carried out two complex \nwalking protocols containing blocks of straight walking  (Figure 1a) , navigated walking  (Figure 1b) , and navigated \nwalking while performing an auditory Stroop task. fNIRS measurement was performed with a NIRSport2 device \n(NIRx) with 8x8 optodes arranged over the prefrontal area, with short -separation channels. Region of interest analysis \nwas performed over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  Gait parameters were measured with  inertial measurement units, \nbalance with the Mini -BESTest , and executive ability with a trail -making test . 1st level  analysis was performed via \ngeneral linear model with autoregress ive pre -whitening  (1), and 2nd level  analysis via linear mixed -effects models.  \n \nResults: Both OA and PD had significant increase  in dlPFC activity  from baseline to \nnavigated walking (OA β=1.26, T=4.52, p<.01; PD β=1.29, T=4.87, p<.01), but not straight \nwalking. Both OA and PD had an increase in dlPFC activity  from straight walking to \nnavigated walking (OA β=1.25, T=4.30, p<.01; PD β=1.04, T=3.63, p<.01), while neither had \nan increase from navigated walking to dual -task navigated walking. Mixed model i nteraction  \neffects present in both protocols were that OA had a relationship between dlPFC activity and \nexecutive ability, while PD had a relationship w ith balance . There was no correlation  between \nexecutive ability and walking speed . There was a positive correlation  between balance ability \nand walking speed for OA (R=0.42, p=.013), but not for PD. \n \nConclusion:  Results could suggest that OA with lower executive function  require more \ncognitive resources to keep the same walking speed , while cognitive resource use in PD  \nduring navigated walking  is more regulated by balance ability.  \n \nAcknowledgements and funding: This study was supported by grants from the Norrbacka -\nEugenia foundation, the Swedish Research Council, Swedish Parkinson Foundation, and \nKarolinska Institutet.  \n \n1.

Our results present  two distinct  functional connectivity \nprofiles in toddlers and preschool -aged children as they relate to  psychological evaluations , parental \ncharacteristics,  and genetic risk . These data are the first  to map the early ontogeny  of ADHD  outside \nof the traditional  narrow demographic .  \n \nIntroduction:  Children typically exhibiting  severe symptoms of ADHD ( i.e., male s with  hyperactiv ity subtype ) are \nidentified and treated  up to 3 years sooner than all other children affected by this neurodevelopmental disorder. \nPresently, there is little data investigating the underlying  connectivity profiles  that drive ADHD in children  under the \nage of 3. fNIRS provides a unique opportunity to explore potential markers of ADHD ontogeny in children as young \nas toddlers who fall outside of this narrow demographic.   \nMethods: 204 children  2-5 years old, 98 of which had a known familial history of \nADHD,  participated in the  current study. An fNIRS probe covering  bilateral \nfrontal -temporal -parietal cortex was worn by children while they passively viewed \nsoothing videos with synchronized classical music (Figure 1A). Additional \nassessments of temperament (ECBQ/CBQ ) and behavior  (SDQ  and MAP -DB) \nwere collected to further categorize  children . Partial correlations ensured  half the \nsample captured  children at risk for ADHD controlling for other pathologies  and  \nage.  \nResults: Children at risk for ADHD display ed less bilateral frontal connectivity  \nand less robust connectivity within left hemisphere (Figure 1C) compared  to \ntypically developing children  (Figure 1B) . Specifically, greater connectivity within \nbilateral parietal cortex was most predictive of risk status. Partial correlations \ncontrolling for age  revealed that the cognitive  dysregulation  and behavioral \ndifficulties  predicted the strength of connectivity in left hemisphere  within \nrisk children . Specifically, sadness and parent -rated ability  of their father’s  capacity \nto self -regulate and mothers’  ability to  attentional focusing ( r=-0.183,  p=0.039)  \nwere most predictive  of bilateral connectivity . In contrast, connectivity i n left \nhemisphere was predicted by both parents’  ability to  inhibit  (r= - 0.259,  p= 0.003)  \nin risk children .  \nConclusion:  Results suggest that children fail to integrate the use of their frontal \ncortex during passive viewing by age 5 . Instead , children  at risk for ADHD overly \nrely on  parietal cortex engagement to direct attention in a bottom -up fashion.  The \nresults  suggest that the neural age of onset for ADHD is likely much younger \nthan previous  evidence suggest . These data are the first to assess the neural underpinnings of risk for ADHD in  young \nchildren while holistically accounting for the entire phenotype of this order a nd clinically including factors such as \nparental stress , parent characteristics, familial health history, and child’s emotional  development prior to the age of \nviable ADHD diagnos is. \n \n \n \n \n \nA)\nR correctedB)\nC)\nR corrected\nFigure 1.

    "Towards an fNIRS foundation model using self-supervision \nto improve machine learning classification \nJ Benerradi a, J Clos b, ML Wilson b \na Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, UK \nb School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK  \nPresenting Author email address: jb2615@cam.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  We propose a novel approach based on self-supervised learning taking advantage of \nunlabelled segments of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings to pretrain a \nneural network for classifying n-back levels from brain data. A self-supervised convolutional \nencoder-decoder was trained on a pretext task consisting in predicting deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR) \ndata from oxyhaemoglobin (HbO), and vice versa. The trained encoder can then be used as a basis \nfor training a subsequent supervised classifier. Ongoing work is investigating this self-supervised \napproach with more unlabelled data from other datasets to build a robust fNIRS foundation model. \nIntroduction:  While machine learning models have been widely used to classify functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) data, they often have limited generalisation capabilities1. An explanation may lie in the limited \nsize of available datasets combined with the high dimensionality of fNIRS recordings (multi-channel time series data). \nData augmentation can be used to mitigate this issue, however, since it is common to have in fNIRS recordings \nunlabelled intervals separating the task trials or other tasks unrelated to the classification goal, we investigated an \napproach to make the most out of the real data at \ndisposition instead of creating artificial data. It \nconsisted in using unlabelled fNIRS recording segments \nfor a self-supervised representation learning task to \npretrain a machine learning classifier.  \nMethods:  We focused in this work on a dataset of n-\nback tasks2, a common paradigm for studying mental \nworkload, with the goal of performing classification of \nthe different conditions (0-back vs. 2-back vs. 3-back) \nin a subject-independent fashion (evaluation with leave-\nsubjects-out). For this purpose, we first used a pretext \ntask consisting in reconstructing deoxyhaemoglobin \n(HbR) signal from oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) and HbO \nsignal from HbR, performed with a convolutional \nencoder-decoder neural network model ( Fig. 1). The \nmodel therefore encoded each channel type into features \nbased on the relationship with the other channel type.  \nThis pretext task was performed using all the labelled \nn-back data as well as the remaining data of the \nrecordings (intervals between tasks) in a self-supervised manner. After training the model on this pretext task, this \nlearnt knowledge is transferred to the downstream classification task, by connecting the encoder’s pretrained layers to \nfully connected classification layers that were subsequently trained on the labelled n-back data only, in a supervised \nmanner. The models were trained, optimised and evaluated with BenchNIRS1 and come to extend this open-source \nPython benchmarking framework, adding support for self-supervised learning with fNIRS. \nResults: This approach enabled us to train the model on 104 extra unlabelled trials in addition to the 702 labelled \ntrials. Initial results when pretraining our model on the reconstruction task enabled to reach a classification accuracy \nof 34.8% as evaluated on data from unseen subjects with 5-fold cross validation, which is low but on par with subject-\nindependent fully supervised classification baseline benchmarks on this n-back task which remains challenging1. \nConclusion: Our explorations are opening new avenues for future research in machine learning with fNIRS, since \nusing pretext tasks enables to introduce expert knowledge into models to go towards more relevant and explainable \ninferences. Ongoing work is focusing on improving those initial results by performing the self-supervised learning \ntask on much more unlabelled data from other datasets with the goal of building a robust foundation model for fNIRS. \n1.

    "Two voices two stores : Different speakers generate separate \nmemory traces in newborns  \n \nEmma Visibelli1, Ana Fló1, Silvia Benavides -Varela1 \n \n1 Padova Neuroscience Center, Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisation, University of Padua, | Via Venezia 8, Padua, Italy  \nEmail address: emma.visibelli@phd.unipd.it  \n \nAbstract:  Neonate's phonological memory capacities and its neural correlates are mostly unclear. \nWhile different studies suggest that infants can retain phonological information from birth, \nmemories seem fragile and susceptible to interference. The current study aims to understand whether \nacoustic novelty can prevent this interference. Newborns were tested using a  familiarization -\ninterference -test paradigm  while cortical activity was measured using fNIRS.  Results show an \nincreased hemodynamic response to the novel word compared to the familiar one during the test \nphase over frontal, temporal and parietal areas, suggesting that acoustic variability promotes the \nmaintenance of the familiar word memory trace.  \n \nIntroduction:  Studies  using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) show that newborns presented with a \ndisyllabic word for a few minutes recognise it a few minutes later. However,  recognition vanishes when they hear a \ndifferent word during the retention period , while it is preserved when instrumental music is presented (Benavides -\nVarela et al., 2011). Based on this and on previous evidence suggesting that acoustic variability promo tes word \nlearning ( Rost & McMurray, 2009; Estes & Lew -Williams, 2015; Katus et al., 2024 ), we hypothesize  that acoustic \nnovelty , i.e., another voice utter ing the interference word, might preserve word recognition .  \nMethods: 32 newborns (2-5 days) were tested in a within -subject familiarization -interference -test paradigm \n(Benavides et al., 2011, 2017), while cortical neural activity was recorded over frontal, temporal, and parietal \nregions using a 42-channel fNIRS (NIRx NIRSPort, wavelength=760 and 850 nm ) with 16 sources and 15 detectors \n(source -detector distance approx. 2cm) . Pseudowords were presented in a block design (5 blocks of 6 words each, \nISI 0.5 -1.5 s, inter -block interval 25 -35 s). In one condition, neonates heard the s ame word during habituation and \ntest, and in another condition, a novel word was presented in the test. Each participant took part in both conditions.  \nResults: During the test phase, a linear mixed regression model shows greater neural activation in respo nse to a new \nword compared to the familiar one during the second block of the test in the left (β=0.31, p=0.027) and right \n(β=0.033, p=0.018) inferior frontal gyrus, left (β=0.53, p=0.0002) and right (β=0.34, p=0.016) superior temporal \ngyrus, and left pari etal lobe (β=0.28, p=0.044). These results reveal  that neonatal verbal short -term memory of the \nfamiliar word is retained when the interference word has different acoustic features.  \nConclusion:  We show that neonates can retain a disyllabic word even when followed by an interference word if a \ndifferent speaker utters it. These findings can be linked to an interference -resistant mnemonic mechanism, possibly \ndue to a better differentiation of the me mory traces.  \n \nReferences:  \nBenavides -Varela, S., Gómez, D.

While NIR technologies can monitor placenta oxygenation,\nconsideration needs to be given of how these NIR devices can store, process and present the data\nin a safe, real-time and efficient way. We will outline and demonstrate an AWS based cloud\ncomputing pipeline that allows (1) to secure the data from a portable wearable NIRS device that\nwe developed called FetalSense; (2) pre- and post- process the data with real-time quality checks\nand algorithms to resolve physiological quantities; and (3) display information of clinical value.\nIntroduction: The Prevention of Stillbirth using Optical Technologies and Knowledge Transfer (PROSPEKT)\nproject aims to develop wearable NIR instrumentation for continuous functional placental monitoring and to\ndemonstrate its utility for early warning of pregnancy complications in a feasibility study in two different settings\n(UCLH, London, UK, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India). FetalSense is a portable NIRS\ndevice with a multi-distance photon trajectory configuration, allowing acquisition of quantities such as placenta\noxygenation and metabolism. The Cloud-based system will automatically secure the data, pre-process it to remove\nartefacts before applying computationally advanced algorithms, and display resulting information of clinical value.\nMethods: The device contains a microprocessor which has been programmed to send datafiles to a specific folder\non a nearby laptop, via a USB or bluetooth connection (see Figure 1). A continuous background process detects new\nraw data being received and uses the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to upload it to a secure data bucket,\nbefore verifying the data is present in the cloud. The raw data is converted to the SNIRF [1] standardised data format\nfor accessibility, then pre-processed using denoising, cosmic ray and motion artefact removal. Then a diffusion\nmodel constructed using the in-house `mms-nirs` package (published to PyPi) is used to calculate features such as\noxygenation (oxy- deoxy- haemoglobin) and metabolic (cytochrome-c-oxidase) concentrations [2], with these\nresults visualised through a dashboard. Eventually, integrated machine learning models will provide diagnostics\nincluding an early warning for complications.\nFigure 1: The proposed pipeline for automated data handling during the international study. The FetalSense devices are\nconnected to a PC, which uploads data to the cloud for pre- and post- processing before displaying the results in a dashboard.\nResults:The automated upload of the NIRS data to AWS and the verification of that process has been demonstrated,\nwhile the signal processing pipeline has been demonstrated offline.\nConclusion: The cloud based data handling is key for universal and data-secure use of this technology, as well as\nthe rapid return of clinically useful information. It will also be important for the next stages of the research project\nwhen machine learning models are developed, as an increasingly large repository of training data accrues.\n1. bfNIRS Cloud Platform.

We acquired fNIRS data from 7 participants while listening to 24 \nmusical excerpts divided con sidering the valence -arousal model proposed by Russell. We decoded \nspecific quadrants with 53.6% ± 33.1% accuracy. This work validates fNIRS as a viable interface \nfor rehabilitative approaches using music.  \n \nIntroduction : The exploration of music's capacity  to evoke emotions, ranging from basic feelings like happiness and \nsadness to nuanced ones such as tenderness or grief, has drawn significant attention in cognitive and affective \nneuroscience. Emerging technological advancements, particularly fNIRS, offer promising avenues for understanding \nthe neural mechanisms underlying music -induced emotions while being portable and affordable to implement.

The imaging session included two runs of a music -\nlistening task. In total, each participant listened to 24 musical excerpts (7.5 sec ea ch) divided into the 4 quadrants of \nthe valence -arousal circumplex model and labeled by Panda et al. [1]. We used NIRSport2 continuous wave systems, \nsampled at 12.6Hz with 32 sources and 28 detectors near a “whole -head” montage, with 32 short -distance dete ctors. \nPreprocessing consisted of trimming, channels with scalp coupling index below 0.75 were excluded, then converted \nto optical density, corrected for motion artifacts using TDDR [3], converted to variations of oxy - and deoxygenated \nhemoglobin (HbO and HbR), and filtered [0.01 - 0.5]Hz (using MNE -NIRS [2]). GLM analysis included  all channels \n(each music event corresponding to a predictor) with SDD as confounds, as well as physiological measurements \n(respiration, electromyography, heart -rate variability, oxygen s aturation, pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and \ngalvanic skin response). The betas of the music events predictors were used as features in the decoding step [ 3]. We \nused a Linear SVM to decode representations of the four core affects. We used a leave -one-subject -out scheme.  \nResults: We identified the specific quadrants of the Russell model of the music excerpts with 53.6% ± 33.1% accuracy \n(24.4% ± 0.05% using a dummy decoder). The use of a linear kernel leveraged the interpretation of the feature weights \nto the classification model ( Fig. 1), highlighting HbO channels over \nbilateral temporal regions - associated with the auditory cortex (in \nagreement with previous studies using functional magnetic resonance \nimaging).  \nConclusion : Future work will ex plore the relationship between the \nmusical features and the activation patterns. These findings underscore the \nimportance of assessing data quality in fNIRS studies and understanding \nthe impact of physiological time series, further highlighting the potenti al \nof fNIRS in advancing our understanding of emotion regulation and in \ntailoring innovative neurorehabilitation therapies that harness the \ntherapeutic potential of music.  \nAcknowledgments  \nSupport  by FCT grant EXPL/PSI -GER/0948/2021.

    "Regional differences in microvascular regulatory control during \nephemeral blood pressure perturbations  \n \nJoel S. Burma, Hannah Pisk o, Saroor Virk,  Nathan E. Johnson, Jina Seok, Joshua J. Burkart, Ateyeh Soroush,  Chantel T. \nDebert, Kathryn J. Schneider, Jonathan D. Smirl, Jeff F. D unn \nUniversity of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 1N4  \nJoel.burma@ucalgary.ca  \nAbstract: Regional cortical differences in dynamic cerebral autoregulation w ere assessed using functional near -infrared spectroscopy -\nderived transfer function analysis (TFA) estimates. Thirty -two participants (23 females) completed repeated squat -stand maneuvers at \n0.05 and 0.10 Hz with TFA outcome metrics of phase and normalized gai n across motor, frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, somatosensory, \nand occipital cortices. Multiple linear regressions noted no differences with biological sex or hemisphere; however, a greater normalized \ngain and greater phase was present in the occipital cortex.  These insights enhance the understanding of cerebral blood flow regulation \nand emphasize the complexity of vascular responses across different brain regions.  \n \nBackground : Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) describes the cerebrovasculature’s ability to dampen/buffer blood pressure \nalterations to mitigate over - and under -perfusion. This has primarily been quantified in the arterial circulation using transcranial Doppler \nultrasound with a focus on the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. However, the relationship between the arterial and cap illary \ncirculation with respect to dCA is unknown, as well as if different regulation exists between microvascular region s. \nMethods : Thirty -two participants (23 females, 9 males) underwent concurrent functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS , using ? \nfibre pairs and a NIRx scout) , transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), and beat -to-beat blood pressure recordings. Participants completed \n5-minutes of squat -stand maneuvers at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz. Relative o xygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes (HbO/HbR) were \nquantified in the motor, frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, somatosensory, and occipital cortices, while cerebral blood  velocity was \nmeasured in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Transfer function analysis outcome metrics [i.e., phase (radians) and  normalized \ngain (% ΔȝM/mmHg)] were assessed using linear multiple regression between cortical regions with the motor cortices as reference with \nadjustment for hemisphere and biological sex. Correlation analyses assessed the relation between fNIRS and TCD metrics.  \nResults : Occipital phase at 0.10 Hz was greater for HbO (0.20  radians ; 97.5%CI: 0.01 -0.38; p=0.032 ) and HbR (0.42  radians  97.5%CI: \n0.25-0.58; p<0.001 ). Further, normalized gain was larger within the occipital  cortex at both 0.05 and 0.10 Hz for both HbO and HbR \n(range: 0.10 -0.26 %ΔȝM/mmHg  greater; 97.5%CI range: 0.00 -0.37, all p<0.048 ). No hemisphere or sex differences in phase or \nnormalized gain were present (all p>0.186 ). The majority of correlations between TCD and fNIRS metrics displayed minimal to weak \ncorrelations ( r range: -0.17, 0.50).  \nConclusion s: These findings provide a unique assessment of dynamic cerebral autoregulation within the microvasculature, \ndemonstrating regional microvascular differences that differ from the regulatory patterns seen within the larger conduit arte ries. A \npotential autonomic influence may exist between different regions of cortical vasculature. Even with normal autoregulation, blood \npressure is a major confounder of HbR and HbO. Finally, subsequent fNIRS investigations using a greater sampling rate are warranted \nto better understand temporal and cardiac cycle influences on the vasculature.  \n Figure 2: Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular r epresentative traces  from one individual \nduring squat -stand maneuvers at 0.10 Hz.

    "The Neural Foundations of Sound Symbolism  \nin the First Months of Life   \n \nJunker, A.1, Loconsole, M. 1, Regolin, L. 1, Rugani, R. 1, & Benavides -Varela, S. 2,3 \n \n1Department of General Psychology, University of Padova, Via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy,  \n2Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisatio n, Via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy,  \n3Padova Neuroscience Center,  Via Orus 2/B , 3512 9, Padova , Italy. \nPresenting Author email address: annika.junker@unipd.it  \n \nAbstract:  Associations between nonwords such as “bubu” and “kiki” with round and spiky  shapes, \nrespectively, have been found systematically in the literature, yet their underlying neural  processe s \nin the infant brain  are still unclear . The current study investigates the neural mechanisms of this \nphenomenon  in one-to-three -month -old infants  using fNIRS. Twenty -two infants will be tested in \nan infant -controlled cross -modal matching paradigm. In each trial, participants are presented with a \nround or spiky shape, paired with either a “bubu” or “kiki”  sound.  A larger  activation  in the  right  \nsuperior temporal area compared to the left one is expected  for congruent pairs , which will \ndemonstrate the early origins of this effect.  \n \nIntroduction:  Sound symbolism can be described as the non -arbitrary relationship between speech sounds and \nmeaning. Associations between nonwords such as “bubu” and “kiki” with round and angular shapes, respectively, \nhave been found systematically in adults1 and toddlers2, and even prelinguistic infants of four months3. This \nphenomenon could facilitate the emergence of infants’ first vocabulary and provide insight into how language \nevolved4. While the existence of sound symbolism is almost unanimously accepted, it is still unclear how sound \nsymbolism is processed in the infant’s brain . The current study investigates the neural mechanisms of sound \nsymbolism in one-to-three -month -old infants with  relatively  little exposure to language .  \n \nMethods:  Twenty -two one-to-three -month -old infants will be tested in a silent room with an infant -controlled cross -\nmodal matching paradig m (data collection is ongoing) . In each trial,  participants are presented with a round or spiky \nshape, presented at the center of a 21.5 -inch screen, paired with one auditory stimulus of either the nonword “bubu”, \ncongruent with the round shape, or the nonword ”kiki”, congruent with the spiky shape. There are 20 trials , 10 per \ncondition (i.e. congruent and incongruent), each trial lasting 12  s. The order of the trials  is pseudo -randomized and \ncounterbalanced across infants. Auditory stimuli were  recorded using five different female voices  and were matched \nin intensity and duration across conditions.  Each trial c ontain s six alternate  presentations of two different intonations \nof the same s ound and four alternat e presentations of two 180° rotations of the same  visual stimulus . A 6-10 s resting \nperiod was inserted between trials, in which infants are presented with an attention -getter. A NIRx NIRSport machine \nwith a 3 7-channel configuration is used to measure brain activity over bilateral temporal and parietal regions.  Data \nanalysis will compare the activation in each  region of interest  during congruent and incongruent trials for both \nnonwords.  \n \nExpected Results: Based on previous studies, we hypothesize a larger increase in Oxy -hemoglobin in the superior \ntemporal area of the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere for the congruent condition, but not the \nincongruent condition5. \n \nConclusion:  Significant differences in brain activation between the two conditions will demonstrate that prelinguistic \ninfants have the ability to spontaneously map cross -modal sound -symbol pairs and provide evidence for the hypothesis \nthat sound symbolism has its origins in early infancy.  \n \nReferences:  \n1.

In this study, participants engaged in a household chore – laundry – while their frontal lobe brain activity \nwas monitored using fNIRS. Participants completed this twice using both fragranced and unfragranced  detergent , \nto explore  if fNIRS is able to identify any differences in brain activity in response to subtle changes in stimuli . \nAnalysis was conducted  using Automatic IDentification of functional Events (AIDE) software and fNIRS \ncorrelation -based signal improvement (CBSI). Results indicated that brain activity, particularly in the right \nfrontopolar and occasionally the left dorsolateral prefrontal corte x, was more pronounced and frequent with the \nunfragranced detergent than the fragranced.   \n \nMethods: Cortical hemodynamic s were \nmonitored using a  20-channel  fNIRS \nsystem  covering prefrontal and frontal \nregions of the brain  (Fig1). Particular \nevents observed during the experiment, e.g. \nstarting the washing machine load, opening \nthe detergent bottle, were manually marked \nvia the acquisition software.  The order of \ndetergent presentation was \ncounterbalanced across participants. 16 \nfNIRS data sets ( M=50.9 , SD =14.7, \n5M/11F) were  preprocessed using \nHomer2, converted to CBSI and analysed \nusing AIDE. Each functional event was \nassigned to an experimental condition \n(washing, folding, hanging – fragranced \nand unfragranced)  based on the manually  marked timings.  Conditions were compared via channel -wise paired \nsample t -test. \nResults: In the wash condition, results indicate a significantly higher peak activity  (Max t - value) (t(5)= -3.75, \np<0.05; not surviving FDR correction) and higher average brain activity  (Mean t -value) (t(5)= -2.66, p<0.05; not \nsurviving FDR correction) in channel 15 , right frontopolar PFC,  during the unfragranced wash  versus the \nfragranced wash  (Fig2). During clothes hanging, wet unfragranced clothes elicited significantly more frequent \nbrain activity in channel 15 than fragranced  (t(10)= -2.33, p<0.05; not surviving FDR correction) , however showed \nsignificantly less frequent activity than fragranced in channel 5 (t(12)=2.49, p<0.05; not surviving FDR \ncorrection) .  \nFig(2) Normalised  group level results comparing Max t -\nvalue (A) and Mean t -value (B) of the Fragranced condition \nto the Unfragranced condition for the wash phase.

    "Effects of Matrix Conditioning strategies on Multifrequency \nHigh-density Diffuse Optical Tomography  \nChengfeng (Aaron) Zhang1, Weihao Fan2, Adam T. Eggebrecht1,3,4,5 \n1Department of Electrical & Engineering, 2Department of Physics, 3Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology,  \n4Department of Biomedical Engineering, 5Devision of Biology & Biomedical Sciences  \nWashington University, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA .  \nAbstract:  High -frequency modulation has been shown to provide superior image quality over \ncontinuous wave high density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT). Herein, we evaluated matrix \nconditioning strategies for multi -frequency HD -DOT for potential improvements in imaging \nperformance.  \nIntroduction:  High -density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT) is an advancement on functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy that uses multiple overlapping light source and detector pairs, to obtain three -dimensional spatial maps \nof brain function. Although most HD -DOT sys tems utilize continuous wave (CW) measurements, recent work has \nshown frequency domain FD -HD-DOT systems hold more promise by providing additional phase information that \nsupports superior image quality and depth sensitivity. In this work, we studied the effects of conditioning methods on \nimage quality for both single - and multi -frequency cases incorporating a realistic noise model.  \nMethods: We simulated a pad consisting of 24 sources (red) and 28 detectors (blue) with near infrared light on a head \nmodel  based on the MNI atlas . (Fig. 1a). The HD-DOT grid had average source - detector separation s of 13, 30, 40, \n48 mm (Fig. 1b) . We used NIRFAST er to model the photon diffusion in the head model  to calculate the Jacobian A \nthat relates measurements at the surface y to internal perturbations in absorption coefficient x via y=Ax+N, where N \nis a realistic noise model . We investigate d five different conditioning methods on the Jacobian  matrix  A including  \nmax conditioning, mean conditioning, column max conditioning , and column mean conditioning to investigate  the \neffect of conditioning  given the realistic noise N, which is a function of both source -detector distance and modulation \nfrequency . We quantified imaging performance with multiple  image metric s, including  localization error  (LE) , full \nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) , success rate (the % of voxels with a LE<8mm), and flat field reconstruction  (FFR) . \nResults and Conclusion : The conditioning method has a strong effect at larger penetration depths  (Fig. 1 c, d). Column \nmax conditioning and mean conditioning provide s smaller FWHM when considering the mean FWHM from 5mm to \n15mm depth. Column conditioning provide s the smallest localization error and the best  success rate. Column \nconditioning also showed the best  FFR results across image domain.  Column max conditioning is the most robust \napproach  by being  one of  the best two conditioning strateg ies considering all me trics mentioned above  while max \nconditioning is the least robust approach, especially in the presence of noise and as a function of depth. Column max \nconditioning achieved the best performance because it creates  the best balance of amplitude sensitivity and phase \nsensitivity from different frequencies  in the Jacobian matrix  among all conditioning strategies by  narrowing the \ndifferences of sensitivities from amplitude and phase parts of different frequencies  for different voxels. With proper \nconditioning and combining two frequencies, FD -HD-DOT could provide adequate image quality up to a depth of \n30mm, more than 50% improvement compared to previous CW simulations  that provide penetration depth limited  to \n~20mm with realistic noise. In the future, we will validate the improving performance of the matrix conditioning \nmulti -frequency approach using  cross -modal subject -matched  HD-DOT and  fMRI  data. \n Figure 1:  (a) High-density array  with 24 sources (red) and 28 detectors (blue).

Introduction : Functional diffuse correlation spectroscopy  (fDCS) is a technique with potential use in studies \ndue to their noise robustness and minimal setup requirements. In this work, we integrate fDCS with \nelectroencephalography (EEG) as a new tool for brain imaging in six -month -old infants enabling the study  the \nneurovascular coupling under a mechanism involved in the speech processing in neurodevelopmental stages.  \n2. Methods : We used the two types of stimuli from Ref. [ 1] with an alternating and non -alternating block design . \nfDCS and EEG data were recorded u sing a 3D -printed probe that integrates two EEG electrodes, and 2 sources \nand 8 detectors per hemisphere positioned in the temporal , region of the brain where the greatest activity was \nfound in Ref. [ 1], and frontotemporal  lobes . \n3. Results & Discussion : To date (the study is on -going), a  total of  18 infants participa ted in the study . 13 out of \n18 were included in the final EEG analysis and 10 out of 18 were included for fDCS data analysis. Preliminary \nresults showed differences in response to A lternating and Non-Alternating blocks  for EEG  (Fig1.A ). fDCS  \nshowed  greater activation in the Non-Alternating blocks in the right temporal  area (Fig1.B) , mirroring  findings of \nRef. [1] in neonates. These preliminary results show that co-registering EEG and fDCS provide s an effective \nmeasure of speech processing, partially mirroring previous findings with fNIRS  [1, 2] but with the hypothesis that \nit would provide further insights into the neurovascular coupling once integrated with fNIR S. This will be the \nsecond step of our research. fDCS showed greater activation in the Non -Alternating blocks in the right temporal \narea (Fig1.B)  which goes according to our findings with EEG  (Fig1.A) .  \n \nFig1.

    "Accounting for head size distributions in cross-sectional and \nlongitudinal pediatric fNIRS studies  \n \nXuetong Zhai1, Theodore Huppert1, Hendrik Santosa2 \n \n1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \n2Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, PA. USA  \nxuz19 @pitt.edu  \nAbstract:  fNIRS  is sensitive to the structure and thickness of extra -cerebral layers — particularly, \nthe sinus cavities and the layer of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). This uncertainty creates the potential \nfor systematic bias in analysis of fNIRS measurements in longitudin al development studies , because \nthe sensitivity of fNIRS measurements decays exponentially with the depth of brain activity from \nthe surface sensors. The study characterize s differences in head anatomy and their effect on expected \nfNIRS sensitivity using e xisting structural MRI data from pediatric populations , then develop s and \ncompare s analytical methods to account for this variability in fNIRS analysis focusing on cross -\nsectional and longitudinal stud ies. \n \nIntroduction:  While fNIRS non -invasively measures changes in \ncerebral hemoglobin oxygen status like the fMRI blood oxygen level \ndependent (BOLD) signal, a limitation of fNIRS is that it is unable to \nprovide direct structural information about the underlying tissue. Sinc e \nfNIRS records the brain from surface -mounted sensors, this technique \nis sensitive to the structure and thickness of extra -cerebral layers — \nparticularly, the sinus cavities and the layer of cerebral spinal fluid \n(CSF). This uncertainty creat es the potential for systematic bias in \nanalysis of fNIRS measurements between gender or age groups and in \nlongitudinal development studies. This is because the sensitivity of \nfNIRS measurements decays exponentially with the depth of brain \nactivity from the surface sensors. Even seemingly small systematic \nstructural differences (2 -3mm) between groups can produce large biases \n(26%) in the recorded fNIRS signals . \nMethods: This work first c haracterize s the distribution of anatomical \nvariations in the head structure from existing pediatric and infant MRI \ndata.  Unlike MRI pediatric atlases, our focus is on the extracerebral \nlayers since these have much larger influence on the path of light in the \nhead and the sensitivity of the fNIRS measurements to the underlying \nbrain , then examine s how the variations in anatomy translate to expected variations in \nthe fNIRS sensitivity  using differential and partial optical pathlength based on Monte \nCarlo modeling of the optical radiative transport equation (RTE) . With this information, \nwe can c ompare the sensitivity, specificity, and potential bias of analysis strategies to \naccount for anatomical variations in cross -sectional and longitudinal fNIRS studies  using \nstatistical methodologies including look-up tables, DPF only correction, and statistical \nmediation models , latent variable statistical models , etc. \nResults: Figure  1 compares the traditional and the proposed atlases and shows the \nhistograms  of scalp thickness using the two registrations where the proposed approach \ngives a more concentrated distribution. With this anatomy information, we can obtain \nthe corresponding brain activity using the simulation models (e.g. Figure 2), which can \nbe incorporated into statistical models to correct the optical effects and result into more \naccurate estima tes. \nConclusion:  This study develop s statistical  methods to account for anatomical  \nvariability in cross -sectional and longitudinal fNIRS analysis  incorporating a novel atlas \nregistration focusing on the alignment of extracerebral layer s.     \nReference:  Whiteman AC, Santosa  H, Chen DF, Perlman S, Huppert T.

    "The Influence of the Believability of Conclusions on Cortical \nActivation  During Categorical Syllogistic Reasoning Tasks  \n \nE. Hosokawaa, K. Okamotoa, K. Nakazawaa, T. Tejimaa, Y. Kyutokua, I. Dana \n \na, Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory , Chuo University , Tokyo,  Japan , \nPresenting Author email address:  a20.km5s@g.chuo -u.ac.jp  (E. Hosokawa)  \n \nAbstract:  Research on syllogistic reasoning tasks has explored the effects of belief by assessing if \nconflicts exist between the believability and logical validity of conclusions  (belief -logic conflict) . \nHowever, it is also indicate d that cortical  activ ation  differences can stem from the believability of \nthe conclusion, independent of  the belief -logic conflic t. This study investigated  whether the \nbelievability of conclusions  affects reasoning also  in categorical syllogistic reasoning tasks and how \nthese interact with the conflicts. we confirm ed that differences in cortical  activ ation  in these tasks \ncorrelate with the believability of conclusions.  \n \nIntroduction:  The syllogistic reasoning task consists of two premises and one conclusion, where the task is to assess \nwhether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. It has been reported that belief bias, a bias where the \nbelief in the conclusion affects reasoning, occurs during this task . In studying belief bias during the syllogistic \nreasoning task, conditions are typically divided into con gruent  and incon gruent  conditions, based on whether there is \na belief -logic conflic t. In the incon gruent  conditions, compared to the con gruent  ones, t here was an increase in \nresponse time  (RT) , a decrease in accuracy  (ACC) , and greater activation in the right lateral prefrontal cortex  (rlPFC)1. \nHowever, a study  using relational syllogistic reasoning tasks ha s reported activation in the rlPFC  irrespective of the  \nbelief -logic conflict , simply if the conclusion is not believ able2. Thus, the existing  division into the two  conditions \nmay not adequately capture the influence of belief.  Additionally, the effects of the believability of conclusions on \nbrain activ ation  in categorical syllogistic reasoning tasks have been yet to be known.  Therefore, this study examine d \nthe impact of the believability of conclusions on cortical  activation  in categorical syllogistic reasoning tasks, and how \ndifferences between conditions vary accordingly.  \n \nMethods: Thirty  participants were recruited and presented with 32 tasks of categorical syllogistic reasoning. \nParticipants were asked  to decide whether the conclusions were logically valid.  Δ[oxyHb]  during the tasks were  \nmeasured using the multichannel fNIRS  device. The timeline date  was analyzed using General Linear Model (GLM) \nto compute β values, which served as indicators of cortical  activation . RTs, ACCs , and β values were subject to a 2  x \n2 repeated measures ANOVA, with the factors being the believability and logical validity  of the conclusions.  \n \nResults: The results  indicated  above threshold effect size in a  main effect \nof the believability of conclusions on cortical  activation  and ACCs . There \nwas increased activation in the bilateral  supramarginal gyrus  and the right \nangular gyrus, and a decrease in ACC s for conclusions deemed not \nbelievable. In RTs, an interaction was observed; conditions  with belief -logic \nconflict  resulted in longer RTs compared to conditions without the conflict. \nHowever, no difference in RTs was found between conditions where \nconclusions were believable but not logically valid, and those that were not \nbelievable and not  logically valid.  \n \nConclusion:  The results suggest that the believability of conclusions influences cortical  activation  also in categorical \nsyllogistic reasoning tasks, as well as  ACCs  and RTs. However, while synergistic  difference s according to belief -logic \nconflict and an unbelievable conclusion  were observed in RTs, they were not evident in cortical  activation . Further \nanalysis  focusing on the temporal signal structure  would be necessary to better differentiate  cognitive components \nreflecting believability of conclusions  and belief -logic conflic t. \n \nReferences : \n1.

    "Influence of Skin in the Estimation of Optical Properties \nwith Frequency -Domain Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy  \n \nG.G. Martins1*, L.F. Bortoletto1 and R.C. Mesquita1,2 \n \n1Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics , Univer sity of Campinas , Campinas, SP, Brazil  \n2School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham , United Kingdom   \nPresenting Author email address: ggrisoti@ifi.unicamp.br  \n \nAbstract:  This study investigate d the bias in troduced in  the optical properties estimated with FD-\nDOS when skin is ignored . We derived the  skin’s absorption coefficient as a function of skin colou r \nand used this relationship to quantify the influence of skin on the absorption coefficient  of turbid \nmedia . We show that dark skin introduces errors of up to 9% in the absorption coefficient  and 4.5% \nin oxygen saturation . Last, we propose a skin -dependent correction factor to decrease the bias in \nFD-DOS .  \n \nIntroduction:  Occult hypoxemia is a clinical condition in which oxygen saturation (𝑆𝑡𝑂2) is below 88% while \nmeasurements of pulse oximeters are 92% or more. The COVID -19 pandemic highlighted that this 4% difference  was \nenough to create a  bias for ethnic and racial factors  and spoil clinical decisions  [1], affecting about 30% of black \npeople and only 17% of whites. Additionally, black patients had a 29% lower hazard of treatment eligibility \nrecognition compared to whites, and almost 55% of the patients who were never  eligible for treatment were black. In \nthis context, this work investigate d the influence of the skin, especially dark  skin, on the accuracy of the optical \nestimations provided by  Frequency -Domain Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy  (FD-DOS) .  \n \nMethods: Skin colour was quantified with the Individual Topological Angle (ITA°) . For each wavelength (691 and \n851 nm),  we derived a quantitative relationship between ITAº and the absorption coefficient of skin, 𝜇𝑎𝑠, using \npreviously published data collected with a commercial spatial frequency -modulated spectroscopy device (OxImager \nRSTM, Modulim, Inc.)  [2]. For each  ITA°  value , we simulated FD -DOS data for source -detector separations (SDS) \nranging from 1 to 4 cm using a two -layered model containing a thin first layer (1.50 mm) to represent skin. The \nabsorption coefficient of the second layer ( 𝜇𝑎𝑡) was also varied between 0.05–0.45 𝑐𝑚−1. The results were compared \nwith a similar simulation  without the skin  layer, which allowed us to find an empirical correction factor for amplitude \nand phase dependent on skin colour. This factor was further validated in actual data collected on the ventral upper arm \nof 15 participants (8 males, 35(12) years) using a commercial FD -DOS system (Imagent, ISS) for 2 minutes at rest.  \n \nResults: The relationship between log(𝜇𝑎𝑠) and ITA was adjust ed well with a linear model  for both wavelengths  (Rð \n= 0.87 and 0.67 for 691 and 851 nm, 𝑝<10−5). The simulations showe d that dark skin attenuated FD-DOS amplitude  \nby 15-fold across  all SDS . As expected, phase shifts did not exceed 0.03 rad  since the scattering coefficient was kept \nthe same in all simulations . The inclusion of skin  introduced a mean absolute percentage error in the absorption \ncoefficient of the second layer of 1.4 (95% CI: 0.2 – 5.6)% for 691 nm and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.1 – 4.2)% for 851 nm, \nreinforcing that skin bias is more pronounced for small wavelengths due to higher absorption. This error was translated \nto a 1.1 ( 95% CI: 0.1 – 4.3)% in 𝑆𝑡𝑂2. When applied to simulated data, the correction factor capped the errors in 𝑆𝑡𝑂2 \nto the 95th percentile of 3.4%. On the upper arm , the correction  factor changed  the absorption coefficient by 0.7 (95% \nCI: 0.1 – 3.0)% , which result ed in a 𝑆𝑡𝑂2 change  of  0.5 (95% CI: 0.1 – 2.7)% , with a maximum  increase  of 6.0% , \nwhich is the magnitude scale of occult hypoxemia . \n \nConclusion:  Our results suggest that ignoring dark skin introduces an error of up to 9% in the absorption coefficient, \nwhich translates to 4.5% in 𝑆𝑡𝑂2. The correction  factor  proposed reduced the error, particularly in the high -end side \nof the distribution, which reduces the incidence of the occult hypoxemia phenomenon  in FD -DOS . \n \nAcknowledg ements: We thank Thinh Phan and Anthony Durking (University of California ) for sharing data acquired \nthrough the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Numbers R01GM108634  and P41EB015890 . \n \nReferences:  1.

Anderson3, Marta ýeko1, Leanne Hirshfield1,2 \n \n1Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA  \n2Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA  \n3Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA  \n4Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University, TX, USA  \n5United States Air Force Academy, USAF A, CO, USA \nCorresponding author: J. Crum, James.Crum@colorado.edu  \n \nAbstract:  A growing interest in how information -based threats such as misinformation affect \ncognition, emotion, behavior, and well -being has led to important insights into human \nsusceptibility and resiliency factors, as well as intervention strategies aiming to mitigate negative \neffects, but how these predictors play out during real -world behavior in naturalistic environments \nremains much less clear. We urge researchers to lever age recent advancements in ecological \nneuroscience  to investigate  a range o f naturalistic behaviors and situations involving \nmisinformation . We follow this recommendation by first examining predictive relationships \nbetween multimodal data  and misinformation susceptibility factors . \n \nIntroduction : Incoming information from the world affects information -processing systems in the brain in a myriad \nof ways: Often it is innocuous or beneficial, but sometimes it can be disruptive and deleterious. Such information \nrepresents a threat in terms of its potential to alter or otherwise disrupt human information processing . This aspect of \n‘cognitive security ’ largely represents the human side of information security, and therefore has become exceedingly \nrelevant to cybersecurity issues1 as well as digital solutions in mass -communication technologies2. Moreover, this \nhuman side of cognitive security concerning the receivers (e.g., users) of mis/disinformation  who believe and act on \nit (e.g., sharing, liking, etc.) represents a central focus and vein of research within the social and behavioral \nsciences3. Recently , the American Psychological Association formally  acknowledged  the dangers of health -related \nmisinformation, reviewing the latest research in experimental psychology on the factors that increase the likelihood \nof forming and disseminating erroneous and deceptive information4. However, interactions between the ability to \ndiscern and reject erroneous or misleading information  and the neurocognitive systems supporting performance in \nthe naturalistic environments  in which this kind of information might be encountered remain poorly understood from \na cognitive neuroscience perspective5. The present work therefore aims to use a multimodal approach (fMRI, fNIRS, \nEEG, eye tracking, accelerometers, & physiological monitors) to explore interrelationships between psychological,  \nbehavioral, and neurophysiological sources of misinformation susceptibility . Methods: Although this project will \nspan different testing environments, task complexities, and levels of scientific explanation, its first phase in 2024 \nwill focus on using this multimodal approach to assess predictive relationships between neurophysiological signals, \nbehavior, and psychometric -based factors of susceptibility during simple and widely used tasks in cognitive \nneuroscience (i.e., when ecological validity is low); subsequent phases will assess these relations using more \ncomplex tasks that reflect natural behavior in occupational situations.

    "Using concurrent fNIRS and fMRI to computationally \nmodel deep -brain activity  \n \nJames Crum1, Nitin Kumar2, Emily Doherty1,2, Leanne Hirshfield1,2, Marta ýeko1 \n \n1Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA  \n2Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA  \nCorresponding author: J. Crum, James.Crum@colorado.edu  \n \nAbstract:  In this study, w e adopt  a multimodal approach  to synchronously record surface and \ndeep -brain activity using fMRI and fNIRS during a set of  replicable cognitive tasks  to develop  \ncomputational  models  for predicting deep -brain activity from surface -level activity as measured \nby fNIRS. This will provide preliminary roadmaps for fNIRS researchers to leverage fMRI to \nimprove modeling of brain data collected by fNIRS  in lab -based  and real -world environments.  \n \nIntroduction : Although f unctional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) and functional near -infrared spectroscopy \n(fNIRS) are two distinct, non -invasive techniques that take advantage of magnetic and optical principles, \nrespectively, they are both predicated on the mechanisms of neurovascular coupling . Therefore, s tudies have \ncompared  fMRI and fNIRS signals —either simultaneously or separately —showing  strong  correlat ions, with positive \nrelationships  between increased levels of BOLD signal and HbO 2 and, most commonly, negative  relationships \nbetween BOLD and HbR . This is  especially the case in outer cortical areas ( i.e., closest to the scalp) where fNIRS \nsignal s are collected , since  fNIRS lacks the penetration  to reach deep -brain regions afforded by fMRI.  However, \nrobust correlation s between fMRI and fNIRS signals can be leveraged  to advance the integration of the two \nmodalities  across the different levels of coverage afforded by these complementary techniques . More specifically,  it \nis plausible that the whole -brain coverage  afforded by fMRI could be leveraged to estimate changes in subcortical \nhemodynamics in fNIRS experiments. For example , recent research has used simultaneous fNIRS -fMRI recordings \nto predict fMRI activity in deep -brain regions from fNIRS data using support vector regression algorithm s. The \npresent study aims to develop computational  models using machine learning algorithms that can infer deep -brain \nactivations from fNIRS data.  Methods: We will use fMRI (3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner ) and fMRI -compatible \nfNIRS (Borealis, NIRx) to synchronously record surface and deep -brain activity while participants (n = 200) \nperform a comprehensive set of simple , computer -based  tasks that (a) are replicable across neuroimaging platforms \n(e.g., those used in Human Connectome Projects ); (b) elicit diverse brain responses  across multiple domains, \nrelating  to (1) sensorimotor  processing (finger tapping) , (2) visual affect ( valence d stimuli), (3) somatic affect \n(thermal pain),  (4) working memory (n -back) , (5) cognitive control (go/nogo), and (6) social processing \n(mentalizing); and (c) activate a widespread network of cortical and deep brain areas to serve as comprehensive \nbrain localizers. Physiological signals such as heart rate and respiration will also be collected.  Next, we will use \nnovel machine learning approaches (deep neural networks) to develop within - and between -subject computational \nmodels of whole deep -brain fMRI activity from surface -recorded fNIRS  activity. These will include 3 -dimensional \nconvolutional neural networks (3d -CNNs) to model spatial dependencies coupled with recurrent neural networks \n(RNNs) to model temporal dependencies in the data . We will then test our models across tasks to determine whether \nour model can robustly and accurately predict deep -brain activity across a range of cognitive functions and task \ndemands. Results: Data collection is ongoing with results pending.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.  If fMRI activity in  cortical region  X (a) is correlated with fNIRS  \nactivity in cortical region X (b), and fMRI activity in subcortical region Y (c) is \ncorrelated with (a), then activity in (b) is likely also correlated with activity in (c).   \n Figure 2.

    "Where in the brain is the dax? Mapping word learning in the \nchild brain  \nStephanie Castro and Maria M. Arredondo  \n \nDepartment of Human Development and Family Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, 108 East Dean Keeton Austin, Texas 78 712  \nstephanie.castro@utexas.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Young children have the remarkable ability to learn  language in a short time period . Here , \nwe investigate  the functional brain regions support ing children’s word learning. Toddlers wore a \nfNIRS cap while completing  a word mapping task. We found that children showed an increase in \nHbO activity in the left frontal gyrus when mapping novel labels to unfamiliar objects . Children \nalso showed an increase in HbO activ ity in bilateral frontal and temporal brain regions  during a \nretention test phase , with left frontal exhibiting the most activity . The se results  provide  \ndevelopmental evidence that left frontal brain regions support  young children’s  word acquisition . \n \nIntroduction:  During the first three  years of life , children  have a unique capacity to  acquire  new words very quickly.  \nUnder a lexical constraints account, Mutual Exclusivity  refers to the cognitive constraint, during early language \ndevelopment periods, that children  assum e that an object may  only have one label  (Markman & Wachtel, 1988) . Under \nthis account , when children are presented with a novel object alongside a familiar object (e.g., ball), they will map a \nnovel label ( e.g., dax) to the novel object (Halberda, 20 03). By 24 months, most children retain the novel object -label \npair (Spiegel & Halberda, 2011) . Most of what we know about how children acquire new words comes from behavioral \nresearch and some neuroimaging techniques  that measure temporal resolution (i.e.,  EEG ). Little is known about the \nfunctional brain regions that support early word acquisition in  young children . In this study, w e investigate the brain \nregions that support young children’s acquisition of new words.  \n \nMethods:  Data collection is ongoing , and we expect to have a larger sample at the SfNIRS  conference. Currently, \nnine toddlers  (M = 29.3 months, range = 25 to 32 months)  have participated in the study . The sample is majority \nfemale (77.8%) , predominantly White (55.6%)  followed by Asian ( 33.3% ). Participants wore a fNIRS  cap while they \ncompleted a fast -mapping  task. The task includ ed two portions : a learning phase and a retention phase. During the \nlearning phase, children were presented with  two objects  – a familiar item and a n unfamiliar item – on an eye  tracking \nmonitor.  Familiar items included ball, car, and shoe. Unfamiliar items were called dax and nil. During the learning \nphase, 18 trials were randomized and two conditions were presented: F amiliar  (in which the familiar object was \nlabele d) and Disambiguation  (in which the unfamiliar object  was labeled) . Next, the Retention phase was presented, \nin which the  two novel objects are displayed and labeled , and word acquisition is measured . \nA NIRSport2 (NIRx Medical Technologies) system wit h 760 and 850 n m wavelengths was used. The set up included \n8 emitters of near -infrared light and 8 detectors, yielding 20 data channels . We examined brain activation in frontal \nand temporal regions  in both hemispheres . Data preprocessing was completed using Homer2.  \n \nResults: Preliminary results revealed greater HbO activity during Disambiguation  trials (relative to  Familiar ) in the \nleft inferior frontal gyrus suggesting that children rel y on this region for novel object -label mapping . During Retention  \ntrials (relative to Familiar and Disambiguation trials) , children showed  greater HbO activity in bilateral  superior frontal \nregions and bilateral  temporal regions, which are areas associated with memory and language process ing (see Figure \n1). Furthermore, left frontal region exhibited the most brain activity \nduring Retention relative to other regions.  Data collection is ongoing ; \nchildren’s looking behavior will be analyzed and correlated to fNIRS \nresults.  \n \nConclusion:  These results suggest that young children already show \nleft lateralization and reliance on left inferior frontal gy rus for word \nacquisition . The results are limited due to a small sample size, which \nwe plan to expand. This work provides the foundation for future \nstudies investigating the functional mechanisms supporting children’s \nsuccessful word learning.  \nFigure  1: HbO activity for bilateral frontal and temporal \nregions during word learnin g 238 of 398",

We  have  previously  demonstrated  the  ability  of  the \n system  to  accurately  measure  absolute  optical  properties  and  tissue  oxygen  saturation.  Here,  we \n will  present  a  highly  configurable  form  factor  t hat  we’ve  made  to  enable  additional  applications \n using  our  core  modular  TD-NIRS  technology .  We  will  share  results  that  demonstrate  the  ability  of \n our  system  to  resolve  functional  brain  activation  along  with  physiological  signals.  In  summary, \n these  technological  innovations  allow  for  the  development  of  new  applications  of  TD-fNIRS  that \n use a modular, scalable system for measuring multimodal brain signals. \n Introduction:  Functional  near-infrared  spectroscopy  (fNIRS)  has  a  critical  role  for  neuroimaging  applications  as  the \n method  is  movement-tolerant  and  head-worn  allowing  for  natural  interaction  with  the  environment.  Time-domain \n fNIRS  (TD-fNIRS)  enables  absolute  measures  of  oxy-  and  deoxyhemoglobin  concentrat ions  (HbO  and  HbR),  and \n can  correct  for  superficial  signal  contamination  at  each  measurement  channel.  The  modular  Kernel  Flow  system  was \n developed  as  a  wearable  system  that  can  provide  TD-fNIRS  measurements  using  components  that  are  typically  used \n in  consumer  electronics,  building  a  scalable  system  that  maintains  the  performance  of  and  is  less  ex pensive  than \n comparable systems. \n Methods:  The  Kernel  Flow  optical  modules  contain  3  dual-wavelength  laser  sources,  6  detectors,  and  a  dedicated \n instrument  response  function  (IRF)  detector  for  accurate  absolute  oxygenation  measures.  This  new  configurable \n form  factor  supports  up  to  12  modules  that  can  be  used  to  create  application-specific  headgear  (Fig .  1a).  The  system \n sampling  rate  is  up  to  8  Hz  due  to  the  3.5ms  integration  time  of  the  time-resolved  detectors,  which  is  sufficient  to \n accurately  measure  the  cardiac  pulse  rate.  To  demonstrate  the  ability  of  the  system  to  record  brain  signals,  a \n participant  completed  a  finger  tapping  task.  The  participant  alternated  between  17.5  s  of  sequenti al  finger  tapping \n (right  or  left  hand)  and  15-25s  of  rest  following  visual  cues.  Data  underwent  standard  preprocessing  steps  in  order  to \n obtain changes in the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR)  (  1  ,  2  )  . \n Fig  1.  a)  Example  cap  design  using  the  modular  system.  b)  Spatial  map  showing  HbO  and  HbR  GLM  responses  to  a  finger  tapping  task.  c) \n Example epoched channel response time courses during finger tapping. \n Results:  Brain  signals  from  the  Kernel  Flow  system  are  shown.  The  finger  tapping  task  showed  activation  over  the \n left  motor  cortex  during  right  hand  tapping  as  compared  to  left  hand  tapping  (Fig.  1b).  The  time  courses  showed  the \n expected patterns of increasing HbO and decreasing HbR (Fig. 1c). \n Conclusion:  The  Kernel  Flow  modular  system  is  able  to  capture  unique  signals  that  may  be  important  for \n neuroscientific  applications.  Absolute  oxyhemoglobin  measures  may  allow  for  more  stable  measurements  over \n different  days  as  compared  to  relative  measures  captured  by  continuous  wave  fNIRS.  Improved  removal  of \n superficial  signa ls  may  also  contribute  to  more  accurate  measurements  of  brain  activity.  Further  work  will  include \n extended recordings in ecologically valid environments to further demonstrate the utility of the Kernel Flow system. \n References: \n 1.  A.

The  Kernel  Flow2  system  has \n several  updates  from  the  first  generation  Kernel  Flow  system  including  a  custom \n Application-Specific  Integrated  Circuit  (ASIC),  improved  laser  drivers,  modules  with  integrated \n Instrument  Response  Function  measurement,  compact  Fresnel  optics,  a  redesigned  headset  layout \n for  improved  channel  count  and  coverage,  and  increased  headset  comfort.  We  describe  the  system \n in detail and show reconstructed brain activations from a validation task in humans. \n Introduction:  Time  domain  (TD)  optical  neuroimagin g  systems  use  short  pulses  of  light  and  detectors  capable  of \n measuring  single  photons  to  capture  a  distribution  of  their  times  of  flights.  This  detailed  measurement  capability \n gives  these  systems  two  key  advantages  over  their  continuous  wave  (CW)  counterparts:  they  have  better  depth \n sensitivity,  and  they  can  yield  absolute  optical  properties.  Desp ite  these  benefits,  time  domain  systems  have  limited \n commercial  availability,  and  most  of  those  systems  that  are  available  have  slow  sampling  frequencies  or  limited \n coverage  over  the  head  (  1  )  .  Our  team  has  overcome  the  technical  challenges  involved  in  developing  a  whole-head \n coverage  time  domain  diffuse  optical  tomography  (TD-DOT)  system,  and  we  present  here  characterization  results \n and a human validation task. \n Methods:  Flow2  was  characterized  according  to  the  BIP,  MEDPHOT,  and  nEUROPt  protocols  (  2  –  4  )  .  To \n demonstrate  the  ability  of  the  system  to  record  brain  signals,  a  participant  completed  a  finger  tapping  task.  The \n finger  tapping  task  consisted  of  17.5  s  of  sequential  finger  tapping  (right  or  left  hand)  and  15-25s  of  rest  following \n visual  cues.  Data  preprocessing  procedures  have  been  extensively  detailed  in  our  previous  studies  (  5  ,  6  )  .  We  derived \n the  moments  of  the  photon  time-of-flight  distributions  (intensity,  mean  time,  and  variance).  An  atlas  head  model \n with  approximate  coordinates  for  each  of  the  40  Flow2   modules  containing  the  optical  sources  and  detectors  were \n used.  The  time-resolved  Jacobian  for  each  optical  property  was  mapped  to  each  moment.

    "Classifying the Prefrontal Cortex Reasoning Process Using \nCLEVR Cognitive Task s \n \nBumjun Koh1*, Sangseong Kim1*, Byungju Park2, Seongkwon Yu1, Yuqing Liang1, Jimin Lee1, \nand Hyeon -Min Bae1  \n1School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute  of Science and Technology  (KAIST) , Daejeon, Republic of Korea  \n2VUNO Inc , Seoul , Republic of Korea  \n*michaelkoh@kaist.ac.kr , woanderer@kaist.ac.kr  \n \nAbstract:  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is widely recognized for its pivotal role in relational \nreasoning. Existing  PFC reasoning diagnostic tests show  limitations due to  learning effect and \nfailure to control for quantitative difficulty . Addressing this challenge, th is study proposes a novel \ncognitive reasoning task built for fNIRS  based on  AI dataset s for computer vision. Tasks were \ncategorized based on their relational or non -relational nature, as well as their level of quantitative \ndifficulty. NIRSIT -Lite was employed to analyze the PFC activation patterns.  Significant  and \nconsistent  activation was observed during relational tasks irrespective of the task difficulty.  \n \nIntroduction:  Relational reasoning, which identifies the relationship between objects, is a fundamental cognitive \nprocess primarily associated with the PFC. Prior studies  have  demonstrated the functionality of the PFC by assessing \nbrain activation via fMRI while subjects are engage d in problem -solving tasks such as Raven’s Progressive Matrices \n(RPM)  [1]. However, RPM -based cognitive task s suffer from two limitations : the absence of quantitative difficulty \nadjustment , and the learning effect of a human . To solve this problem, we propose a new relational reasoning \nevaluation protocol  that combines a portable fNIRS device and the CLEVR [2] dataset. The CLEVR dataset , originally \ndeveloped for the evaluation of computer vision system,  offers the advantage of minimizing the learning effect by \ngenerating random questions, thereby enhancing the robustness of cognitive assessments.  \nMethods: 17 healthy adults performed the CLEVR cognitive test. The CLEVR -based cognitive task s was \nautomatically generated  by extracting information from  hundred -thousand  images with up to 1 million  questions. Each \nsubject completed  20 task trials , alternating between relational and non -relational tasks  (R, NR) with random ized \ndifficulty  levels  determined  by the number of objects presented in the questions. Each task trial includes  fixation (20s)  \nand problem solving (60s). T he subjects ’ brain hemodynamic activity was recorded and analyzed by NIRSIT -Lite \n(OBELAB Inc, Seoul)  device . The mean HbO levels of each channel were compared between task types using a t -test, \nassuming different population variances.  \nResults: Channel s 4, 5, 10 , which are associated with the RLPFC  region , exhibited  significantly higher HbO level s \nduring the  perform ance of  R task s compared to NR task s. 15x15 Pearson correlation matrices for R and NR were \ncreated  and evaluated . No significan t correlation between  mean HbO level s and difficulty was observed , neither in  \nthe R nor NR task s when analyzed collectively . \nConclusion:  The p roposed task effectively  differentiated  between relational and non -relational reasoning process es. \nThis shows its potential  utility  for diagnosing PFC -related diseases  such as depression  with portable fNIRS device s. \nReferences:  \n[1] V Prabhakaran et. al .

    "Optimizing Short Distance Diffuse Correlation  Spectroscopy  \nSaeed Samaei1,2, Daniel Milej1,2, Leena N. Shoemaker1,2,3, and Keith St. Lawrence1,2 \n1Department of Medical Biophysics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada  \n2Lawson Health Research Institute, Imaging Program, London, Ontario, Canada  \n3School of Kinesiology, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada  \nPresenting Author's email address: ssamaie@uwo.ca  \nDiffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a promising method for non -invasive ly monitoring \ncerebral blood flow  (CBF).  Its accura cy requires accounting for  signal contamination from scalp \nblood flow, typically performed by recording DCS signals at a short source -detector separation \n(SDS) , in addition to a longer SDS that provides sensitivity to CBF . However, balancing the signal -\nto-noise ratio (SNR) at the two distances is challeng ing. Our study investigates the potential impact \nof emitter light intensity on short separation  DCS measurements . \nIntroduction:  DCS is a promising non -invasive light -based technique for measuring  tissue perfusion  that is used \nprimarily to assess  CBF [1]. The a ccura cy of  CBF  monitoring  can be impacted by signal  contamination from the  \nsuperficial layers  of the head . Although  advanced approaches like time -resolved DCS (trDCS) offer greater  depth \nsensitivity [2], extracerebral contamination remains a central challenge with continuous wave DCS . Typically, DCS \ndata are acquired at a short and long SDS to monitor CBF and scalp blood flow . Due to the substantial  reduction in  \ncount rate  with distance  [3], greater illumination power is required  to improve long -channel SNR . This can overload \nthe detector at the short SDS, typically less than 1 cm, leading to errors in the coherent factor  (β) and the blood flow \nindex ( BFI). This study investigate d the effects of illumination power on a short DCS channel and provide d a solution \nto overcome this challenge.  \nMethods:  Experiments were conduct ed using tissue -mimicking phantoms  with DCS data collected at SDS = 0.7 and \n2.8 cm. Illumination power was systematically reduced by a variable neutral density attenuator over nine steps from \n50% to 0.2% of the laser output power. Other experimental parameters, such as phantom temperature, were maintained \nthroughout  data collection . Intensity autocorrelation data were modeled using the homogeneous model with the BFI \ncharacterized by the Brownian diffusion coefficient ( 𝛼𝐷𝐵) [1]. Estimated 𝛼𝐷𝐵 from the long channel at maximum \nillumination power was considered the true value for comparative analysis.  \nBased on the phantom experiments ( explained below) , the short  DCS channel was modified to include a fiber splitter \nto reduce light intensity by 99%.  To demonstrate this approach , a cuff occlusion experiment on a forearm was \nperformed prior to and after adjusting the light intensity level for the short channel detector.  \nResults: Phantom experiment results showed a substantial increase in β (from 0.15 to 0.5 ) due to decreasing light \nintensity to the short channel detector. At 𝛽=0.15, 𝛼𝐷𝐵 was overestimated by 40% . When β increased to  0.5, 𝛼𝐷𝐵 \nfrom the short channel  converged to the true value . From the cuff experiments, baseline BFI and the hyperemic peak \nafter cuff deflation were substantially greater than the corresponding data acquired at SDS = 2.8 cm. These unexpected \ndifferences were removed when the experiments were  performed with the fiber splitter installed.  \nConclusion:  Our study underscores the importance of limiting  the light intensity recorded at a short SDS  for DCS . \nThis research advances our understanding of DCS methodology, emphasizing the importance of calibrating light \ndelivery to detector threshold levels to ensure the reliability and accuracy of DCS measurements.  \n[1] Durduran, T., et al.

    "Assessing the Reproducibility of a Hybrid Time-Resolved \nNIRS/DCS System for Daily Hemodynamic ICU Monitoring \n \nFarah Kamar1,2,*, Saeed Samaei1,2, Rasa Eskandari1,2, Leena N. Shoemaker1,2,  \nDaniel Milej1,2, Mamadou Diop1,2, and Keith St. Lawrence1,2 \n \n1Department of Medical Biophysics, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street N., London, Ontario, Canada  \n2Imaging Program, Lawson Health Research Institute, 268 Grosvenor Street, London, Ontario, Canada   \n*Presenting Author email address: fkamar@uwo.ca  \n \nAbstract:  Bedside cerebral oxygenation and blood flow monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU) \nhas the potential to improve  early detection of cerebral ischemia . To assess the feasibility of daily \noptical monitoring , the reproducibility of oxygenation and blood flow measurements using an in -\nhouse built time-resolved NIRS/DCS system was assessed.  Data were collected on three days (1,2, \nand 7);  each consisted of three acquisition  sessions  where the probes were removed and re -secured  \nbetween sessions . Oxygenation varied by <6% within and between  sessions, wh ile blood flow varied \nby 15% within sessions and 26% between sessions .  \n \nIntroduction:  Secondary brain injury , such as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), is a major contributor  to the mortality \nand disability of patient s with neurological emergencies . Invasive techniques can detect early symptoms of DCI (i.e., \nimpaired cerebral blood flow  (CBF)  and altered energy metabol ites) before clinical signs manifest1,2. To provide non-\ninvasive CBF and oxygen metabolism  monitoring , we developed a hybrid system combining time-resolved near-\ninfrared spectroscopy (tr NIRS)  to measur e tissue oxygenation (StO 2) with diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to \nmeasure CBF3. Prior to clinical studies, the purpose of the current work was to establish the reproducibility of daily \nmeasurements.  Repeat measurements were acquired within each session and between days to determine between  and \nwithin -session reproducibility. Instrument precision was determined using  a tissue -mimicking phantom . \n \nMethods:  Time -resolved NIRS/DCS data were acquired from healthy participants on three days (1, 2, and 7). These \ndays were select ed to reflect the period when DCI typically manifest s. Data were collected from the forehead at a \nsource -detector distance of 3.5 cm for trNIRS and 2.8 cm for DCS. On each day, three  acquisitions were recorded , \nwith the probes removed and re -secured between acquisition s. Probe placement was based on  the 10 -20 system . Blood \npressure , arterial oxygen saturation, and end -tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before \neach acquisition. The absorption and reduced scatter ing coefficients ( µa and µ s¢) were \nobtained from  the tr NIRS data and StO 2 derived from moment analysis3-5. Similarly,  \nthe blood flow index (BFI) was quantified  from DCS  using the homogeneous model  \nwith µa and µ s¢ values from trNIRS.  Reproducibility was quantified by the coefficient \nof variation (CV). The phantom experiments were conducted using a homogeneous \nliquid phantom of milk , India ink, and water. The probes were removed and re -secured \nbetween acquisition s. \n \nResults: Preliminary data have been acquired from three participants (24 -40 years; 2 \nmales, 1 female) . Between and within -session  CV of BFI and StO 2 are shown in the \nfigure. Between -session variability of µa and µ s¢ was ≤12%. No differences in blood \npressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and end -tidal carbon dioxide were found between \ndays.  In the phantom study, between -session variability was <1% for all parameters.  \n \nConclusion:  The p hantom experiments demonstrate d high instrument reproducibility  for both trNIRS and DCS . In \nthe human studies, variability was larger for BFI than StO 2. BFI variability was also greater than previous imaging \nstudies (MRI and PET) that  reported inter -session CV of the order of 15%.6,7 Higher variability in DCS could be \ndriven by changes in scalp blood flow due to probe contact pressure . Future work will  include  directly measuring \nprobe pressure and incorporating short -distance measurements to investigate  multi -layer  modelling approaches.  \n \nReferences :  \n[1] A.

    "Effects of contrast water therapy on tissue oxygen \nmetabolism and muscle fatigue recovery \n \nShunsaku Hirota1, Mikie Nakabayashi1, Shunsaku Koga2, Masashi Ichinose3, Yumie Ono4 \n \n 1 Electrical Engineering Program, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan  \n2 Applied Physiology Laboratory, Kobe Design University, Kobe, Japan  \n3 Human Integrative Physiology Laboratory, School of Business Administration, Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan  \n4 Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan  \nce231064@meiji.ac.jp  \n \nAbstract:  Using diffuse correlation and near -infrared spectroscopy, we investigated the effects of  \ncontrast water  therapy (CWT)  on recovery from exercise -induced skeletal muscle fatigue . After \ninducing muscle fatigue with static handgrip exercise, participants performed CWT or rested at \nroom temperature as a control. Exercise capacity  was then assessed by performing incremental \nrhythmic handgrip exercise until volitional exhaustion . CWT increased oxygen metabolism  of the \nlocal muscle and post -treatment exercise capacity, suggesting its significant role for fatigue recovery.  \n \nIntroduction:  Facilitate  recovery from muscle fatigue is important for prevention of sports injuries. Contrast water \ntherapy (CWT), which alternates between warm and cold baths, is widely used to promote  recovery from muscle \nfatigue. However, there have been few quantitative studies on its fatigue recovery effects focusing on local muscle \nfunction. In this study, the effect s of post -fatigue CWT on active muscle function  in handgrip exercise  were evaluated \nby electromyography (EMG), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), and near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).  \n \nMethods: Ten healthy recreationally active young adults  (age: 22. 3 ± 0.6 years ) were participated in the study . The \nparticipants  performed a 2 -min rhythmic  hand grip exercise  (2 s contraction, 2 s relaxation) at 30% maximal voluntary \ncontraction (MVC), followed by a 3 -min static contraction at 50% MVC to generate muscle fatigue. In the CWT \ncondition, the forearm of the exercised limb was alternately immersed in warm  water (42°C, 2 min) and cold water \n(10°C, 1 min) three times each.  In the control  (Ctrl)  condition, the forearm w as placed in a room temperature for the \nsame duration of CWT. Then, rhythmic handgrip exercise was again per formed at 30% MVC for 2 min, followed by \nincremental rhythmic handgrip exercise in which the load was gradually increased by 10% MVC every 2 min until \nvolitional exhaustion.  EMG mean power frequency (MPF) during the 2 -min rhythmic  handgrip exercise  at 30% MVC  \npre and post muscle fatigue  was calculated. T he relative metabolic rate of oxygen (rMRO 2) was derived from DCS -\nNIRS . Exercise capacity was evaluated by cumulative load during the incremental exercise.  \n \nResults: MPF of EMG during exercise was lower after muscle \nfatigue than before muscle fatigue in both conditions, but it did not \nsignificantly differ between conditions  (Table 1) . The rMRO 2 during \nthe treatment period  in the CWT condition was significantly higher \nthan the Ctrl condition.  (Figu re 1). Participants tolerated incremental \nexercise longer in the CWT condition, resulting in higher exercise \ncapacity than in the Ctrl condition  (Table 1) .  \n \nTable 1 Group mean of active muscle function variables   Ctrl CWT MPF (Hz)  Pre  78.7 ± 5.3  79.7 ± 3.9  Post   74.9 ± 6.0  †   71.3 ± 4.2  † Exercise duration  (s) 346 ± 49   414 ± 43 ⁑ Exercise capacity (kg ·s) 124 ± 26    167 ± 25  ⁑ († p < 0.0 1, Pre vs. Post, ⁑ p < 0.01, Ctrl vs. CWT. ) \n \nConclusion: The rMRO 2 during treatment under CWT condition was higher and the subsequent exercise capacity \nwas increased. These results suggest that the CWT promoted tissue oxygen metabolism, alleviated fatigue, and led \nto improved exercise performance. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal CWT method for fatigue \nrecovery effects, including water temperature and immersion time  for warm and cold baths .   \nFigure 1: Changes in rMRO2 in control \n(Ctrl) and contrast water therapy (CWT)  \n conditions.

    "Validating the reproducibility of a low -cost single -channel \nfNIRS device across hierarchical cognitive tasks  \n \nXu Shi Yang1, Zhang Chao1* \n \n1Faculty of Education Science, Shanxi Normal University, Taiyuan, China   \nCorresponding Authors: zhangchao951217@163.com  \n \nAbstract:  This study evaluates a low -cost, single -channel fNIRS device in cognitive neuroscience, \naiming to overcome financial barriers by testing its efficacy in tasks of varying complexity. Results \nconfirmed the device's ability to detect significant blood flow ch anges across motor control, working \nmemory, and creativity tasks, supporting its use as a cost -effective tool for diverse cognitive \nassessments.  \nIntroduction:  fNIRS is a key non -invasive tool in cognitive neuroscience, but its widespread use is limited by the \nhigh cost of commercial systems. Low -cost, single -channel fNIRS devices have emerged as potential solutions, but \nrequire further validation across a range of cognitive functions. This study aimed to rigorously test a modified low -\ncost fNIRS device in tasks spanning motor control to complex cognition.  \nMethods: 26 participants completed finger -tapping (motor control), n -back (working memory), and Alternate Uses \n(creativity) tasks while prefrontal cortex activity was monitored with the fNIRS device  (HEGduino V2, \nhttps://github.com/joshbrew/HEG_ESP32_Delobotomizer ). Behavioral performance and blood flow changes were \nrecorded. The finger -tapping task had blocks of rest and active tapping. The n -back had 1 - and 2 -back conditions \ncomparing current stimuli to 1 or 2 priors . The Alternate Uses task assessed creative thinking.  \nResults: The low -cost fNIRS device detected significant blood flow changes in the prefrontal cortex across the \ndifferent tasks. Hemodynamic responses corresponded with task engagement compared to rest periods. The device \ncaptured differences between the 1 -back and 2-back working memory load and blood flow patterns associated with \ncreative idea generation.  \nConclusion:  Despite its low cost, the modified single -channel fNIRS device proved to be a reliable and valid tool for \nassessing brain activity during cognitive tasks varying in complexity. This represents a significant step in making \nfNIRS technology more accessible f or cognitive research. The device's efficacy across motor, working memory, and \ncreativity tasks supports its potential for widespread use.  \n \nFIGURE 1: Hardware setup of the modified HEGduino device.

    "Attrition rates on an infant fNIRS social touch study  \nLivia Campos,  Isabella Francischelli,  Camila Ribeiro  Julia Terra, Ana Osório  \nMackenzie Presbyterian University, São Paulo (SP) Brazil . \nPresenting Author email address: Liviabranco5@gmail.com  \nAbstract: This work examines  the attrition rates among infants on a study exploring social touch. \nForty -seven  infants  were  assessed using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)  at 6 months, \nof which 34 infants have returned for a 10 -month visit at the time of writing.  Attrition Rate was \n10.6% at 6 months of age and 47% among 10-month -olds. Given that the paradigm remained the \nsame at both time points, it appears that older infant age may be an important factor contributing to \nattrition rates.  \nIntroduction : Attrition rates in infant studies are notoriously high, when compared to adult studies  (Baek et al., 2023) . \nA recent meta -analysis comprising 272 fNIRS experiments with infants aged 0 -24 months reported an average attrition \nrate of 34.23%  (Baek et al., 2023) . Our goal is to determine infant and paradigm -driven attrition rates on a study on \nsocial touch with infants at 6 and 10 months of age .  \nMethods: Forty -seven  infants  were  assessed using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)  at 6 months, of \nwhich 34 infants have returned for a 10 -month visit  at the time of writing (data collection is ongoing) . The same \nexperiment was conducted on both visits: gentle hand strokes were applied to the infants' left shoulder blades by a \ntrained experimenter hidden behind a curtain in 16 trials ( each comprising 3 seconds of baseline + 15 seconds of \nstimulation + 10 seconds of baseline ). In half of the trials, the infant was seated next to their mother, and in the other \nhalf, next to an unfamiliar female . The mother/adult positioned their arm on the back of the chil d’s chair, inducing \nthem to believe the person seating next to them was the source of touch.  Trials were rejected according to  the following \ncriteria: The adult  touched /spoke to the infant ; (b) The  infant  touched the adult; (c) The infant pulled the fibers or \nmoved the NIRS optodes; (d) The infant  saw the researcher  applying the touch ; (e) The infant cried  for over 5 seconds; \n(f) Less than 9 seconds of stimulation was applied; (g) The infant saw the mother/adult remov ing their hand from the \nback of their chair . Only infants with at least three  valid trials on each condition w ere included.  Attrition rate was \ncalculated by dividing the number of infants excluded for not having the required number of trials (for any of the \nabove stated reasons)  by the total number of infants, at each age (6 and 10 months), per condition (mother and \nstranger).  \nResults: Among the 47 6 -month -old infants analyzed, 5 did not had enough valid trials for the mother  (Attrition Rate \n= 10.6%) . All infants  had enough valid trial s in the non -familiar female  condition  (Attrition Rate = 0%) . Forty -two \ninfants had enough valid trials in both conditions ( mother  and unfamiliar woman ) at 6 months of age , leading to an \nattrition rate of 10.6%.  The reason s for trial invalidation were: adult  touched /spoke to the infant (28. 6%), infant  \ntouched the adult  (28.6%), infant pulled the fibers  (23.8%), infant  saw the researcher  (21.4%),  less than 9 seconds of \nstimulation was applied (7.1 %) and the infant cried (7.1%) . On one case the procedure had to be interrupted before all \ntrials were applied  due infant fussiness.  Among  the 34 infants reassessed at  10 months, the number of children that \ndid not have  at least three valid trials was 14 in the mother condition (Attrition Rate = 41.2%) and 16 in the non -\nfamiliar female  condition  (Attrition Rate= 47.0%) . Eighteen 10 months - infants had enough valid trials to allow the \nmother versus unfamiliar woman comparison, leading to an attrition rate of 47 %.  Among 10-month -olds reasons for \ntrials invalidation  were : infant  saw the researcher  (16.7%),  infant  touched the adult  (16.7%), adult  touched /spoke to \nthe infant ( 10%), infant pulled the fibers (6.7%), the infant saw the adult remov ing their hand from their chair  (6.7%) \nand the infant cried ( 3.3%). Four infants  became fussy and/or disturbed by the  non-familiar female  to the point where  \nthe procedure had to be interrupted, five infants rejected the cap, so the procedure was not applied.  \nConclusion:  Our results showed a five -fold increase in attrition rates from 6 to 10 months in a social touch paradigm \nthat involved manipulating the identity of the touch agent (mother versus stranger). Given that the paradigm remained \nthe same at both time points, it appears that older infant age may be an  important factor contributing to attrition rates \nin our study. Possible explanations may be linked to advances in infant mobility as well as increasing preference for \nphysical proximity to the attachment  figure and fearfulness to strangers.  \nReferences: Baek, S., Marques, S., Casey, K., Testerman, M., McGill, F., & Emberson, L.

    "Artefact detection and removal using ICA-ERBM in fNIRS \nLaura Carlton1,*, Meryem A. Y ücel1, Jacqueline Behrendt2,3, David A. Boas1, Alexander Von L ühmann1,2,3,*\n1Neurophotonics Center, Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA  \n2Intelligent Biomedical Sensing (IBS) Lab, Technische Universität Berlin, 10587 Berlin, Germany  \n3BIFOLD – Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data, 10587 Berlin, Germany  \n*email: lcarlton@bu.edu , vonluehmann@tu -berlin.edu\nAbstract:  We introduce a blind source separation technique for the detection and removal of \nartefacts in fNIRS data . Synthetic HRFs are added to optical density timeseries recorded from three \nsubjects with simultaneous accelerometer and gyroscope recordings. ICA -ERBM is used to identify \nand remove artefacts correlated with motion. We compare the recovery of the synthetic  HRFs after \nmotion correction across methods and observe strong performance from the ICA -ERBM algorithm \nindicating, that with further hyperparamter t uning, it has potential to effectively clean fNIRS signals.  \nIntroduction : fNIRS technology has made significant strides, with the development of lightweight, wearable systems  \nfacilitating studies where participants can move freely and engage in more complex tasks  [1]. However, fNIRS is \nvulnerable to various artefacts, both physiological and non -physiological, which must be mitigated to unveil the true \nneural hemodynamic activity.  We present a novel artefact detection algorithm that exploits the power of ICA -ERBM \nto do unsupervised analysis and separation of latent components in the fNIRS signal. ICA -ERBM harnesses higher \norder statistics and sample dependency, outperform ing other ICA methods in fNIRS  [2]. The advent of higher channel \ncounts promises to greatly improve performance of ICA algorithms to effectively separate latent sources in fNIRS. \nFurthermore, leveraging multimodal data such as accelerometer and gyroscope data enables the identification of \nrelevant sources so they can be effectively removed.   \nMethods: Data was collected from three subjects using the NinjaNirs22 system with  a whole head, high density cap \n(567 channels, 2 wavelengths, resulting in 1134 measurements). The system simultaneously recorded from an inertial \nmeasurement unit (IMU) , placed on top of the head, \nwhich resulted in six auxiliary recordings (x, y, z \ndirections for both the accelerometer and gyroscope). \nSubjects performed  a movement (twist left, twist right, \nnod head, shake head, raise eyebrows, read sentence) \nevery 5 -10 seconds , prompted randomly and repeated \nfive times each  (6-minute run) . \nThe raw intensity data converted to optical density \n(OD). Synthetic hemodynamic response functions \n(HRFs) were added to the OD timeseries every 5 -\n10seconds, each scaled to equate to 2% change in the \nOD of the 850nm measurement. Motion correction and \nbandpa ss filtering (0.01 -0.5Hz) were applied before \nconverting the timeseries to concentration and block \naveraging based on synthetic HRF onsets. These \nrecovered HRFs were compared to the ground truth \nusing correlation (CORR) and root mean squared error (RMSE). This was repeated 50 times for each motion correction \nmethod. For the  ICA-ERBM  algorithm , motion artefacts were identified using Homer3 [3], and principal component \nanalysis was  applied , keeping components that ex plained up to 99% of variance. Artefactual sources were identified \nbased on correlation with accelerometer and gyroscope power spectra and motion detection using Homer3 [3]. These \nsources were then projected back to OD in channel space and subtracted from the original OD timeseries. This was \nrepeated three times or until no motion artefacts were detected. We compare performance to two state of the art motion \ncorrection metho ds from the Homer3 toolbox [3],  splineSG and PCArecurse .  \nResults: ICA-ERBM performs comparably with splineSG and outperforms PCArecurse. There are many  \nhyperpara meters that must still be tuned to optimize the performance of the method,  but it has the potential  to greatly  \nimprove fNIRS artefact removal . \nReferences: [1] A. von Lühmann et al. , “Toward Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW) using functional near -infrared  spectroscopy,”\nCurrent Opinion in Biomedical Engineering , vol. 18, p. 100272, Ju n. 2021, doi: 10.1016/j.cobme.2021.100272.  \n[2] A. von Lühmann, Z.

    "Two Human Datasets Reveal the Benefits of Event -Related \nDesigns and Deconvolution for fNIRS  Research  \nMichaela Kent1,*, Kevin Stubbs1,2,*, Homa Vahidi1,* & Jody C. Culham1,3 \n \n1Western Institute for Neuroscience , 2BrainsCAN, 3Department of Psychology, Western University,  London,  ON, Canada ; *equal contributions  \nmkent28@uwo.ca  | kstubbs5@uwo.ca  | https://github.com/Western -SPRINT/fNIRS -2024_ER -Decon  \n \nAbstract:  Choice of methods for preprocessing and analyzing fNIRS data are extremely important \nand can vary depending on experimental design and  the type of  task being investigated . Here, we \ncontrast  the more commonly used event -related averaging with deconvolution  for event -related \ndesigns . Our results were consistent with the pre -established notion  that deconvolution  is generally \nthe better choice for rapid tasks contaminated by order history effects.  Overall, deconvolution  \n(especially with AR-IRLS ) appears to  be a promising  option for estimating evoked response s. \nIntroduction: Research using fNIRS has relied heavily on block designs, often used with event -related averaging \n(ERA) of activation time courses across repeated blocks. Relatively few fNIRS studies have taken advantage of event -\nrelated (ER) designs and deconvolution analyses (using finite impulse response, FIR, functions). For example, a \nliterature search found approximately five times as many mentions of ERA -related terms compared to deconvolution -\nrelated terms in the fNIRS field over the pa st five years. As with fMRI, ER designs and deconvolution offer benefits \nfor fNIRS, particularly the ability to estimate the time course of activation (even for multiphase trials) without \ncontamination from order history effects and without needing to assume a particular hemodynamic response function. \nThe current study showcases ERA and deconvolution techniques in two event -related fNIRS datasets . \nMethods: We compared  ERA and deconvolution techniques in a rapid event -related motor task (n=24, 12 females ; \nSOA  6s to 9s) and a multiphasic event -related theory -of-mind task (n= 25, 13 males , SOA  22s to 25s). We used \nsimulations with the same timing to inform our interpretations of the real human data (e.g.  order history effects) . \nPreprocessing and a nalyses were conducted in  MATLAB 2022b using AnalyzIR Toolbox, Homer3, and custom \nscripts . Specifically , we adapted AnalyzIR functions to  reduce the computational resources required to perform  robust  \nrandom effects model ing on entire deconvolution datas ets at native resolution . \nResults: In the motor task, deconvolution better accounted for trial history in both HbO and HbR compared to ERA \nin real and simulated data  (Fig 1.a). In the theory -of-mind task, both deconvolution and ERA showed two distinct \npeak responses, though deconvolution led to a cleaner estimate of HbR response (Fig 1.b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Comparison of ERA and deconvolution . (a) In the  rapid event -related motor task , deconvolution \ndemonstrat es a resilience to order history effects  (dotted black line indicates order history effect from simulated \ndata) . (b) In the multi -phasic event -related social interaction task , peak responses  are shown  at two distinct phases of \nthe trial  with moderate differences between techniques.   \nConclusion:  In addition to  superior ecological validity, ER designs are beneficial  when  the time course  of an event \nis of interest, or data is contaminated by order history effects . Deconvolution provides an  alternative to  ERA  that \nmay be preferred  in some circumstances , including for jittered rapid  ER designs  and trials with multiple phases.  \nAcknowledgement : This project  is made possible by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada \nDiscovery Grant to JCC and a Canada First Research Excellence Fund  “BrainsCAN” grant to Western University . 248 of 398",
    "Neural Connectivity in Behaviorally Inhibited Preschoolers : \na NIRS Study  \n \nCaitlin Aloisio , B.S., Theodore Huppert, Ph.D., Hendrik Santosa, Ph.D. , Lindsay Taraban, Ph.D., Jennifer \nSilk, Ph.D. , Koraly Pérez-Edgar, Ph.D., & Judith K. Morgan, Ph.D. \n \nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; Loeffler Building, Pittsburgh, PA 15213  \naloisioc@upmc.edu  \n \nAbstract:  This study tested how observed behavioral inhibition  (BI) in preschool ers was related to \nneural connectivity within the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the lateral prefrontal cortex \n(LPFC): two regions within the ventral attention network (VAN). Higher levels of observed BI were \nrelated to weaker connectivity between the right TPJ and the left LPFC ( t=-2.71, p=0.009), left \nanterior medial PFC ( t=-2.85, p=0.006), and the left TPJ ( t=-2.75,  p=0.008) , and stronger \nconnectivity between the  left TPJ and right LPFC ( t=3.16, p=0.00 3). Our results provide a neural \nbasis for inhibited behavior in preschool -age children, which has previously only been studied in \nadolescents and adults.         \n \nIntroduction:  Behavioral inhibition (BI), defined as fearfulness and wariness in response to novel stimuli, is estimated \nto be present in 15 -20% of preschool -aged children1. BI during the preschool years is associated with heightened risk \nfor anxiety disorders in adolescence2. Prior work suggests that observed behavioral measures of BI may be associated \nwith differences at the neural level during adolescence3, specifically within lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the \ntemporoparietal junction (TPJ). These regions are part of a larger ventral attention network involved in shifting \nattention, updating goals, and mentalizing4. However, little work has examined whether these neural differences are \npresent during the preschool years when BI is first observable.   \nMethods: 60 children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old (53% girls, 47% boys) engaged in two paradigms from \nthe preschool version of Lab -TAB, the Risk Room and Stranger Approach paradigms, which are designed to elicit \nwariness in BI children. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)  data w ere collected during the Stranger Approach \nparadigm, and BI was coded observationally by an established coding system from the Risk Room paradigm \n(“Observed BI”).  Neural data w ere measured using a continuous -wave CW6 NIRS system (TechEn, Milford, MA) . \nWe used fOLD5 to register our anatomical regions of interest. Produced NIRS data were analyzed through MATLAB \n(Mathworks, Natick MA) using the open -source AnalyzIR toolbox6. \nResults: Higher observed BI during Risk Room was associated with weaker connectivity between the right TPJ and \nthe left LPFC ( t=-2.71, p=0.009), left anterior medial PFC ( t=-2.85, p=0.006), and the left TPJ ( t=-2.75,  p=0.008) \nduring Stranger Approach. Higher observed BI during Risk Room was also associated with stronger connectivity \nbetween the left TPJ and right LPFC ( t=3.16, p=0.00 3).   \nConclusion:  Findings provide a neural basis for inhibited behavior in preschool age children. BI children may have a \nmore difficult time shifting goals and attention to support a positive social interaction in the presence of a stranger and \nmay require greater effort to understand others’ intentions and regulate \ntheir own emotions in the presence of a stranger.   \n \nReferences  \n1.

    "NovelfNIRS DigitizationMethodology, Firefly:\nInnovative 3D Imaging and Software\nGerman,J.D.,M.S.,Patton,S.,&Kerr-German,A.N.,PhD\nSide Quest Innovations LLC, Warner Robins, GA 31088\nMercer University, Macon, GA, 31207\nPresenting Author email address: sidequestinnovations@proton.me\nAbstract: Optode location variance due to cap placement and head topology, as well as\nscalp-cortex correlation, are essential aspects of fNIRS research. We present an innovative\ndigitization methodology, Firefly (© pending), utilizing blue-light 3D imaging, color-depth\nmapping, and custom software applications to provide dynamic assessments of optode positioning\nduring capping procedures, compatible with EasyCap and custom probe designs. Pilot data suggest\nour methodology enhances digitization localization and offers a robust solution to convert channel\nspace locations to voxel space locations within the brain volume; ultimately providing researchers\nwith an efficient, unified solution for creating scalp-cortex sensitivity profiles.\nIntroduction: Limited hardware and software for capturing optode locations and scalp-cortex correlations plagues\nfNIRS research. Further, accessibility, portability, and financial limitations make conventional methods impractical\nfor novel applications of fNIRS technology. Variances in optode location, head topology, and scalp-cortex\ncorrelations, make it difficult to compare participant data within and across studies; variances may be compounded\nby challenging populations or environments. Firefly is designed to provide a digitization solution that dynamically\ninforms optode positioning; offering study-specific capping feedback (e.g. relative to landmarks) with synchronous\nverification with existing neuroimaging databases. Firefly also aims to ease the use of custom probe designs to\nfundamentally improve data quality within the fNIRS field.\nMethods: Firefly utilizes a consumer-grade 3D scanner featuring blue-light emitter, 24-bit color texture camera, and\nAI visual tracking, to obtain digital point clouds of capped participants. Firefly has been tested with the EasyCap\nfNIRS capping system (see Figure 1), and designed to accommodate unique probe designs; allowing scientists to\nadapt fNIRS to individual study requirements while maintaining spatial accuracy. Our custom software ingests the\npoint cloud, calculates precise location of sources and detectors, and provides dynamic optode positional accuracy\nfeedback based on the 10-10 system. Upon optimal optode positioning, a sensitivity profile is generated and\nincluded in the study-wide sensitivity profile.\nResults: Pilot data show that Firefly generates highly detailed digitization models at 0.03mm accuracy and 0.07mm\nresolution, and improves optode positional accuracy compared to conventional methods via dynamic feedback\nprovided to the scientist during capping procedures. This innovative methodology reduces time-consuming\nprocesses by improving initial data collection and speeding up analyses.\nConclusion: The nexus of 3D imaging hardware and processes along with our custom software applications\npromotes accessibility, enhances data validity, and allows fNIRS scientists to create anatomically informed\nsensitivity models. We endeavor to engage with the fNIRS community to pilot Firefly and further develop this novel\nmethodology.\n250 of 398",

Results from  350 subjects are presented , relative to differential pathlength  factor , absorption and \nreduced scattering coefficients  distribution and correlation across auxological and demographic indicators. \nThis study provides valuable insights into the expected cerebral optica l properties of the brain  in the pediatric \npopulation, which can be leveraged to improve the reliability of diffuse optical measurements  and simulations.  \n1. Introduction : Precise and reproducible tissue oximetry measurements can play a pivotal role in functional brain  \nmeasurements  [1]. While most of the current fNIRS instrument s, based on continuous -wave (CW) near -infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRS) technology, have demonstrated a good head coverage and effectiveness in numerous \napplications , they still face limitations and uncertainties that hinder their complete trustworthiness  [2]. In this work , \n350 healthy pediatric subjects  have been enrolled to try defining  normal hemodynamic and optical values distribution \nin frontotemporal location s. The reproducibility  and precision  of the employed time-domain (TD) NIRS tissue \noximeter  (NIRSBOX, PIONIRS Srl, Italy ) have  been assessed  and leveraged,  together with the capability of  the device \nto be highly user-independent.   \n2.  Methods: The measurement campaign  was carried out at the Buzzi  Children’s Hospital  in Milano, Italy,  involving \n350 healthy patients aged between 0 and 18 years. The study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the \nDeclaration of Helsinki and received approval from the local ethics committee.  Data acquisition was conducted by a \nteam of 5 clinicians , using a  compact  optical probe ( Goccia  G5, PIONIRS s.r.l., Italy)  [3] with a source -detector \ndistance of 2.5 cm  and a fully -automated acquisition software with built -in data -quality indicators . The measurement \nprotocol consisted in  5 s -long acquisitions , at a 1 Hz sampling  rate, and repeated 5 times  over the same location by \nremoving and re-placi ng the optical probe , in order  to assess the repositioning performance . Measurements were \nacquired  on the left prefrontal cortex (Fp1 of the 10/20 EEG system mapping) . TD-NIRS data was processed using a  \nsemi -infinite homogeneous model  [4]. \n3.  Results : Measurements were quickly and successfully conducted across the entire cohort  (with an average session \nduration o f 3 minutes per subject) . The device exhibited consistent stability and reliability across subjects and over \ntime.  No correlation was observed between  acquisitions  by different operators . Tissue saturation ( StO2 ) showed values \nof 66.9 % ± 4.4 %  (av g ± std) , with a measurement precision of 0.9 %. Total Hemoglobin ( tHb) showed 106.3 µM ± \n17.8 µM (avg ± std)  values  with a precision of 4.2 µM. Correlation between cerebral StO2, and Age of the participant  \nshowed to be substantial . The distribution of  \ndifferential pathlength factors  (DPF), absorption  and \nreduced scattering coefficient values have been  \nassessed , showing no correlation with BMI -z-score  \n(Pearson’s R<0.3)  and moderate correlation with \nparticipants ’ age  (Pearsons’s R >0.5) . Future efforts \nwill focus  on more advanced analysis and model s, to \nleverage the potential of TD_NIRS data in retrieving \ndepth -dependent absolute results.   \n4.

In this work, t he possibility \nto overcome this issue with time-domain near -infrared spectroscopy  technique is assessed , first on phantom \nand then in-vivo, on a large cohort of pediatric subjects  covering a wide range of skin pigmentations . \n \n1. Introduction  \nThe widespread adoption of functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) devices exploiting  light diffusion  in \nbiological  tissues  has brought attention to critical challenges associated with their accuracy and reliability across the \nspectrum of skin pigmentation s [1]. Indeed, m elanosomes situated at the basal layer of the epidermis in human skin, \ndistribute melanin throughout the epidermal thickness, varying between 100 and 300  µm thicknesses across different \nanatomical regions. The presence of melanin significantly influences the optical properties in the first layer of probed \ntissues, particularly affecting light absorption.  Intrinsic features  of Time-domain near -infrared spectroscopy (TD -\nNIRS) can potentially  rectify issues related to superficial layer optical properties, enhancing the accuracy of oximetry \nreadings across diverse skin pigmentation ranges.  In this study, we conducted TD -NIRS measurements on tissue \nmimicking skin phantoms to asses the possibility of overcoming skin pigmentation bias  retrieving promising results ; \nwe then performed measurements on a  cohort of 350 healthy pediatric subjects, encompassing the full spectrum of \nskin pigmentation  to evaluate  the issue in -vivo. \n2.  Methods \nA set of 6 skin phantoms was developed, encompassing the full range of equivalent melanosome volume fraction that \ncan be found in the epidermis across human population. Phantoms have been manufacture d with a scattering \ncoefficient of 20  cm-1 and a average thickness of 200  µm. Nigrosine chromophore was included  with different \nconcentrations  in the phantoms to mimic melanin ’s absorption for different pigmentation levels. Then, a nother set of  \ntissue mimicking  phantoms  [2] has been used  to vary  equivalent  StO2 and tHb  values in the  bottom layer , in order  to \ntest the effect of the overlapped  pigmented superficial layer. After the phantom test, w e conducted non -invasive in -\nvivo measurements at the Buzzi Children’s H ospital , Milano (Italy), utilizing a compact commercially available TD -\nNIRS tissue oximeter [ 3] and the  “Goccia, G5”  optical probe (PIONIRS s.r.l., Italy) with a source -detector distance \nof 2.5 cm . Enrolled subjects were  clinically stable subjects  aged between 0 and 18 years . The Fitzpatrick scale  was \nemployed  [4] to assess skin pigmentation . \n3.  Results \nPhantom measurements showed maximum deviation s from bulk phantom nominal values of < 1 %  for StO2 and tHb \nvalues across all combinations of overlying pigmentation -mimicking  phantoms.

Preliminary results from a task using high-\ndensity optical tomography show  that the emergence of vocal selectivity in infants is influenced by \nmaternal pregnancy -related anxiety. These findings underscore the importance of assessing \nmaternal mental health in understanding early brain development and emphasiz e the need for \nlongitudinal studies  focusing  on the immediate postnatal period that might help  disentangle the \npotential effect of  pre- and post natal contextual factors affecting functional brain development.  \n \nIntroduction:  The PIPKIN project  is a longitudinal study that  aims to investigate the impact of family context (e.g., \nparental  mental health ) on infants cognitive and brain development from pregnancy, through the  immediate postnatal \nperiod  until infants are aged  5 months.  Here, we  present preliminary outcomes from one of the neuroimaging tasks \nfrom this project, which describes  the development of brain responses to auditory vocal  and non -vocal  stimuli over \nthe first week s of life and  evaluates  the potential impact of pregnancy  related  anxiety on these responses.  \n \nMethods: This study was conducted in the home setting  using  an infant -friendly  neuroimaging experimental toolkit \nbased on high -density optical tomography (HD -DOT)  and optimized portable equipment for stimuli presentation . A \nparadigm alternating auditory vocal and non -vocal stimuli was employed to assess vocal selectivity at three time points \nin development within the first month of life. Th is preliminary  sample  included data from 31 participants.  From this,  \n25 participants  contributed  valid data  at the first visit (mean age = 7 days), 28 at the second visit (mean age = 15 days), \nand 27 at the third visit (mean age = 34 days).  Eighteen  participants contributed data at three study time points, while  \n13 participants contributed data at two time points . Cortical hemodynamic activity  was measured using  a HD-DOT \nsystem (LUMO, Gowerlabs) covering bilateral frontal and temporal regions . Recording s took place while participants \nwere in a natural sleep state.  An antenatal questionnaire assessing pregnancy related anxiety  (PRAS)  was administered \nat 32 weeks of pregnancy.  \n \nResults: Statistical  analyses were  carried out using a linear \nmixed model approach  with age,  PRAS scores,  region of interest \n(inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus ) and \nhemisphere  (left and right)  as fixed effect factors, and participant \nas random effects factor . Preliminary  results indicate  that vocal \nselectivity  (i.e., difference between brain responses to vocal and \nnon-vocal stimuli ) is predicted by the interaction between age \nand PRAS scores  (Fig. 1) , while no effect of region  nor \nhemisphere was observed . Our results show  that vocal \nselectivity emerges  during the first weeks  of life in participants \nwith low er PRAS scores, but is not yet  present in participants \nwith higher PRAS scores . \n \nConclusion:  Our p reliminary findings suggest that the development of vocal selectivity might be  influenced by \nmaternal pregnancy -related anxiety, with lower PRAS  scores being  associated with earlier emergence of this \nselectivity. These results highlight  the importance of longitudinal studies conducted in the early postnatal period  for \nunderstanding the potential impact of prenatal factors such as  maternal mental health in functional  brain developmen t. \n253 of 398",

Results showed that categorization in the study phase resulted in relatively greater \nhemodynamic activity in all regions and relatively less hemodynamic activity during the test  phase , but only \nin the left ATL . These findings suggest that tensor decomposition is a feasible approach to analyzing fNIRS \nsignals.  \nIntroduction:  Semantic memory is our permanent store of concepts and categories , such as birds and phones. In this \nexploratory work, fNIRS was used to investigate whether recent advances in the cognitive neuroscience of semantic \nmemory can illuminate priming effects in consumer psychology, with a specific focus on how brand -name product \ncategorization primes purchase intention. In order  to explicate the fNIRS signal, tensor decomposition (TD) was used. \nTD examines the simultaneous impact of time, space, and experimental conditions on the fNIR S signal in order to \nstatistically determin e those time -of-interest (TOI) , region -of-interest (ROI) , and condition combinations (i.e., \ncomponents) that make up the totality of the hemodynamic signal.  Findings from this research can enhance our \nunderstanding of the neural basis of semantic memory for brand -name products, with implications for cognitive, \nconsumer, and clinical neuroscience.  \nMethod: There were three conditions in the study task. In the Semantic Comparison (SC) condition, a categorization \ncue was presented (e.g., “Body part ”) and participants chose the product  picture at the bottom of the screen (e.g., Steve \nMadden Heels  and Wilson Tennis Racket) that matched the product picture at the top of the screen (e.g., Callaway \nGolf Shoes) on that cue. In the Same condition, a “Same” cue was presented and the same Steve Madden Heels picture \nwas presented  at the top of screen . In the Similar condition, a “Similar” cue was presented and a Prada Heels picture \nwas presented  at the top of the screen . Later, in the test task, Steve Madden Heels was paired with Prada Heels and \nparticipants chose the product they would purchase . At test, a control condition was included in which neither product \nhad been previously studied. After the fNIRS  signal was pre process ed, a 3-way tensor with temporal, spatial, and \nconditions factors was constructed for each hemisphere for the study phase and again for the test phase.  Canonical \npolyadic decomposition, a form of TD, was used to compress the fNIRS signal and extract the tempor al x spatial x \ncondition components that represented the signal.  \nResults: In both hemispheres, at both study and test, the first component identified in the TD analysis accounted for \n60-70% of the hemodynamic signal.  For the study phase, a  3×2 (Condition ×Hemisphere) RMANOV A on the \nspatial ×subject weights in the first component s revealed a main effect of Condition , F(2,96)=3.92, MSE =1.313, \np=.024, partial eta2=.075 (SC=.19, Similar= -.01, Same=.05).  For the test phase, a  4×2 (Condition ×Hemisphere) \nRMANOV A on the spatial ×subject weights in the first components revealed a 2 -way interaction , F(3,144)=2.93, \nMSE =1.384, p=.046, partial eta2 = .058 , such that the spatial ×subject weights in the SC condition was less than in the \nSame condition , but only in the left hemisphere  (Left: SC= -.22, Same=.03; R ight: SC= -.01, Same=.01) .  \nConclusion:  Very little work has been done on brand -name products with semantic memory in mind and very little \nwork has been done on the neural organization of semantic memory with brand -name products in mind . The present \nwork targeted this neglected intersection  between brand -name products and the neural organization of semantic \nmemory . There were three surprising findings: the effect of categorization at study in all ROI’s (including the right \nLPFC ), the carryover of the categorization effect in the left ATL at test (as shown by  a relative decrease in \nhemodynamic response ), and the lack of a similar categorization carryover effect in the right ATL at test.  These results \ndemonstrate that fNIRS can be used to explore the neural basis of semantic memory and can also contribute to the \nemerging field of consumer neuroscience.  The results indicate that the type of processing called for in the Semantic \nComparison condition engaged the semantic system more than the type of processing called for in the other  condition s \nand had a longer -lasting effect on the conceptualization of brand -name products. Finally, these results also \ndemonstrate d the viability  of the tensor decomposition (TD) approach to fNIRS signal analysis.  254 of 398",
    "fNIRS Short Channel Regression Improves Cortical \nActivation Estimates of Working Memory Load  \n \nAn J.1,3, Wyser D.2, Luft A.R.1, Awai Easthope C.3, & Schönhammer J .G.1,3 \n \n1. Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland  \n2.  Rehabilitation Engineering  Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland    \n3.Data Analytics and Rehabilitation Technology Lab, Lake Lucerne Institute, Vi tznau, Switzerland  \njiahui.an@ llui.org  \n \nAbstract:  Studies of Working Memory (WM) increasingly use functional Near -Infrared \nSpectroscopy (fNIRS) , especially  because of  its tolerance  to motion  artifacts . However, \nhemodynamics measured with long -distance channels may originate from both cortex  and scalp . \nWe thus applied  an fNIRS system with long and short separation channels in 20 participants during \nn-back tasks  to separate cortical and scalp  signal contributions . We used Generalized and Linear \nMixed  Models for analysis.  Statistical  effects of the n-back level  on hemodynamic  responses were \nenhanced  through  Short Channel Regression (SCR) , hence  demonstrat ing that SCR improves \nvalidity and accuracy of fNIRS measurements of cortical brain activation in WM tasks.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable tool for investigating the cerebral \nhemodynamics associated with cognitive functions, such as Working Memory (WM). Prior fNIRS research replicated \nstudies of WM load that used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), showing that WM load is linked to \nactivity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and Superi or Parietal Cortex (SPC). However, the validity of \nfNIRS measurements can be impacted  by scalp hemodynamics. Hence, we  implement ed Short Channel Regression \n(SCR)  to account for scalp hemodynamic s. By applying  SCR,  specifically  in tasks that manipulate WM load such as \nthe n -back paradigm, we aim to achieve more valid measurements of cerebral activity associated with WM load.  \n  \nMethods: Our study employed a continuous -wave fNIRS device ( optohive, ETH Zurich, Switzerland) to collect data \nfrom 20 young adults (10 males) during 0 to 3 -back tasks. We placed 11 optodes, each comprising a Source (S) and a \nDetector (D) that form a short channel with a n S-D distance of 7.5 mm. Adjacent optodes  created longer channels \nwith an S -D distance of 30 mm, with long channels overlapping the short ones. The optodes were positioned over two \nregions of interest, following a previous fMRI study: eight on the DLPFC and three on the SPC. We analyzed \nhemodynami c activity, both Oxygena ted (HbO) and Deoxygenated Hemoglobin (HbR) of the long channels, using \ntwo Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). GLM1 incorporated regressors for different task levels, and GLM2 \nadditionally included the average hemodynamic response of the short channels, ref lecting scalp hemodynamics. These \nGLMs t-statistics were analyzed with two Linear Mixed Models (L MMs). L MM1 explored global effects with fixed \nfactors of n -back levels and short channels; L MM2 focused on channel -level effects, with fixed factors of n -back \nlevels and long channel s. Both models were controlling for subject variance as random factors.  \n \nResults: Most  effects observed with L MMs were larger for GLM2 results, that is, when scalp hemodynamics were \nconsidered. Thus, we focus on GLM2 results  here: the n-back factors in L MM1, analyz ing global effects, were \nsignificant. Hemodynamic responses  differed  between most  pairs  of n-back levels  for both HbO and HbR  (all |t|> \n3.42, p < 0.002), except for  0 and 1-back which only revealed an effect for  HbR (|t|= 4.78, p < 0.001 ), indicat ing that \nhemodynamic response s were generally larger for higher n -back levels. L MM2 supported  these findings  at channel \nlevel , with  one channel over DLPFC show ing significant difference s for all  pairwise comparison s of consecutive n-\nback levels in HbO  (all |t|> 3. 30, p < 0.013), and most  comparisons for HbR  (all |t|> 2.55, p < 0.022),  except for 0 \nand 1 -back , and 2 and 3 -back . Notably , in L MM1, the short channels’ averaged HbO  significantly explained variance  \n(z=2.10 , p=0.035 ), indicating that  the hemodynamic responses in the long channels included scalp hemodynamic s. \n \nConclusion : This study demonstrated that fNIRS can measure WM load and replicate previous fMRI results. With \noptodes placed over DLPFC and SPC, it can accurately distinguish between WM load levels, especially between 2 \nand 1 -back levels. Our current findings showed that long channels contained both cerebral and scalp hemodynamic s, \nthe impact of which could be reduced with SCR. In conclusion, our findings confirmed that fNIRS can measure \nactivity in WM -related areas and demonstrated that incorporating SCR improves the validity and robustness of these \nmeasurements.   255 of 398",

Data Analytics and Rehabilitation Technology Lab, Lake Lucerne Institute, Vitznau , Switzerland   \njosef.schoenhammer@ llui.org \n \nAbstract:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) gains prominence due to its spatial \nresolution and resistance to motion artifacts, making it ideal for neuroscience and brain -\ncomputer interface applications. However, simplifying and standardizing its data pr ocessing \nremains a challenge. This project introduced fnirsPy , a wrapper built on MNE -Python and \nMNE -NIRS that allows easy deployment of customizable end -to-end data processing pipelines \nwith minimal code. It provides a standard pipeline following current recommendations and \nimplements  new preprocessing methods. fnirsPy , tested with data from 22 subjects across \ntwo systems, significantly enhances data handling, furthers processing standardization, and \nimproves reproducibility in neuroimaging research.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non -invasive neuroimaging technique that is \nfrequently used due to its advantages in spatial resolution and robustness to motion artifacts. However, challenges \nremain in data processing due to the lack of usable and standardized data processing pipelines.  Usage of existing \nsoftware and libraries can be non -trivial and requires significant overhead code. This project developed \nfnirsPy , an open -source wrapper around MNE Python libraries with additional methods and features that makes \nit easy to deploy complete yet customizable end -to-end data processing pipelines for custom fNIRS data with only \na few lines of code. It implements a standardized procedure f or handling data and includes a  default pipeline that \nadheres to current recommendations for fNIRS data processing. The project aims to make open data processing \nfunctionality more usable and to standardize fNIRS data processing to enhance reproducibility across studies.  \n \nMethods: fnirsPy  was developed on MNE -Python  [1] and MNE -\nNIRS  [2] such that a ll MNE functions can still be utilize d \nharmoniously.  A standard pipeline was implemented the follows \ncurrent recommendations for fNIRS data processing [3] , as well as  \nnew methods that are not available  in MNE  (e.g., automatic cardiac -\nsignal based channel selection ), and plotting functions following  \npublication recommendations  [4]. We used data from  overall 22 \nsubjects, collected with  two fNIRS systems  (optohive, ETH Z ürich, \nSwitzerland; Lightnirs, Shimadzu , Japan) , during working memory \nlab tasks .  \n \nResults: The use of fnirsPy  significantly reduced the complexity \nand amount of code required to process fNIRS data, from data \nimportation to final analysis steps  (see Figure) . \n \nConclusion:  fnirsPy  offers a user -friendly, flexible tool, such that \nusers can focus on scientific questions without much toil over writing \ncode. The tool adheres to standard data handling, processing, and \npublication guidelines, thus supporting reproducibility in \nneuroimaging research.

    "Neural Correlates  of Multisensory Enhancement  during \nEmotional Speech Perception in Bilingual and Monolingual \nAdults \nYixian Wang1, Mairéad MacSweeney1,2, Carly A. Anderson1,2  \n1 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience (ICN), University College London , Alexandra House, 17 -19 Queen Square, London, WC1N 3AZ, UK.  \n2 Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London.  \ngrace.wang.20@ucl.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  Language experience can impact how we process faces (visual cues) and voices (auditory \ncues) during social interactions . This study e xplor es the influence of spoken -language bilingualism \non audiovisual integration during emotion al speech  perception . Bilingual and monolingual adults \nwill classify emotion al speech stimuli  expressed through auditory and visual modalities  whilst \ncortical activ ation  is measured from temporal and occipital cortices using  the Shimadzu LabNIRS  \nsystem. It is pre dicted  that the benefit (both behavioral and cortical) of multimodal input, over \nunimodal input, is greater in bilingual than monolingual adults. Results  will elucidate how  language \nexperience shapes  cortical mechanism s underlying this important element of socio-emotional  \ncommunication . \nIntroduction:  Audiovisual (AV) integration  of facial and vocal cues  plays a critical role in optimizing  spoken \ncommunication.  AV integration  may be shaped by bilingualism , with evidence that bilingual  compared to monolingual \nchildren  have better  multitasking ability in AV tasks1 and evidence of faster and more accurate processing of \nconcurrent AV stimuli  in bilingual compared to monolingual adults2. Studies with bilingual infants have  also \ndemonstrated a bias for visual information during dynamic AV speech processing compared to monolinguals3. Despite \nthese insights, the impact of bilingualism on AV integration  when emotion is convey ed by the speech signal  is not \nfully understood . The current  study  aims to address this  by comparing brain activity between bilingual and \nmonolingual adults using fNIRS during an AV emotional speech classification task . We hypothesize that the benefit \n(behavioral and cortical) of multimodal input, over unimodal input, is greater in bilingual than monolingual adults.  \nMethods: We aim to recruit monolingual English -speaking  adults  (n=25) and bilingual English -Chinese speaking \nadults (n =25) between 18 -55 years old. Elements of b ilingual language experience will be measured using a self-\nreport questionnaire . Participants will perform a 6-alternative  forced -choice (AFC) emotion classification task where \nstimuli will comprise dynamic faces and voices articulating pseudowords convey ing 6 possible emotions  (anger, \ndisgust, fear, happiness , sadness, surprise )4. Stimuli will be  presented in the auditory  (A), visual  (V), and AV modality . \nfNIRS recordings  will be acquired from  83 channels placed over bilateral  superior temporal and occipital cortical \nregions  using the Shimadzu LabNIRS system  while participants perfo rm a 2-AFC ‘yes’  ‘no’ emotion classification \ntask in an event -related design. Each t rial will consist of randomly selected emotional stimuli with 10 trials  presented \nin each block. Trials will be blocked  by modality and block presentation order will be randomized. Dependent  \nvariables include  emotion classification  accurac y and the strength of cortical activation  in the regions of interest . Data \nanalysis will be conducted using custom in -house pipelines developed by the fNIRS research community at UCL .  \nResults: From the results of our online pilot experiment, s timuli with accuracy rates  within  ±1 standard deviation of \nthe mean have been selected for use in the fNIRS paradigm.  For each participant, behavioral  ‘multisensory \nenhancement ’ will be calculated as AV accuracy – (A accuracy + V accuracy) , and cortical  ‘multisensory \nenhancement ’ will be calculated as AV activation – (A activation + V activation) . Multiple regression models will be \nused to assess difference s in multisensory enhancement between modalities  and language group s. Correlation analysis \nwill be used to determine  relationship s between cortical  and behavioral measures of multisensory enhancement . \nConclusion:  The current  study  will enable us to understand if  bilingual  adults have a n advantage in visual processing \nand AV integration during emotional speech perception compared to monolingual  adults , and the cortical mechanisms \nunderlying this. Understanding the b enefits of visual information and how this is integrat ed with sound has important \nimplications beyond the current hearing bilingual population . For example, v ocal emotion perception can be  \nchallenging for people who are deaf and use hearing ai ds or cochlear implants  to access spoken language due to the \ndegraded pitch information  that the se device s provide . Our future studies will examine cortical  mechanisms  of \nmultisensory  integration in this population . \nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number 221612/Z/20/Z].  \n1.

    "Optical-imaging XNAT -enabled Informatics: an open-source \nplatform for fNIRS data organization and processing  \n \nYash Thacker1, Emma Speh1, Ari Segel1, Dan Marcus1, Muriah D. Wheelock1, Adam T. Eggebrecht1 \n1Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine 4515 McKinley Ave, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA  \nythacker@wustl.edu   \n \nAbstract:  Standardization and repeatability  are fundamental challenges of the scientific process and \npresent challenges for the growing  fNIRS community. Optical imaging XNAT enabled Informatics  \n(OXI) aims to address these challenges. OXI is a platform built on the robust open -source \ninformatics platform , XNAT , which was built for storage of neuroimaging  data,[1] and provides  data \nstorage, HIP AA compliance, data processing , and data sharing for a new data type , fNIRS. OXI \nrespects the  BIDS structure  and automatically works with  the SNIRF  standard data format . OXI \nprovides  standardized processing pipelines for batch analysis of data without the need for access to \nhigh performance computing.  \n \nIntroduction:  Standardization and repeatability are important for dissemination  of knowledge and validation  within \nthe scientific process . Given that the  fNIRS community  is growing to include larger, multi -site studies,  as has been \nthe case for the  fMRI community, Optical -imaging XNAT -enabled Informatics (OXI) aims to address need s for \nstandardization and repeatability in the context of data storage, data processing, and data sharing. OXI is an open -\nsource platform based on XNAT tailored to meet the needs of the fNIRS community. Built to service  the emerging \nstandards, OXI supports th e BIDS data structure for data storage and builds on NeuroDOT’s capabilities for processing \na wide variety of data types from different systems using Docker containers. Leveraging cloud -based  tools, OXI \nprovides users access to high performance hardware to allow them  to go from data collection and storage to processing \nand sharing it with collaborators and the community.  \n \nMethods: OXI is built on XNAT, an open -source  informatics platform that was developed to support the storage of \nneuroimaging data.[1] XNAT incorporat es features such as Docker container support, data sharing and storage , and \nnative Jupyter notebook support. We leveraged  this mature platform to support the needs of the fNIRS community. \nBIDS is becoming a standard format for data storage, which is very similar to the data storage structrue  XNAT \nsupports . Furthermore, standardizing data processing is essential . While MATLAB and Python help resolve some of \nthese issues, varying versions of software and libraries can influence data processing . XNAT processes data using \npipelines built using Docker containers , which addresses two major challenges that the community faces . First,  OXI \nstandardiz es data processing via self -contained Docker environments  that can run independent of a user’s  local \nenvironment . Second , OXI provid es equitab le \naccess to data processing without the need for \nhigh performance hardware by doing data \nanalysis on  high performance  compute units .  \n \nResults: A new fNIRS data type was created for \nXNAT, along with a zip uploader that can ingest \nBIDS -compliant data sets. Furthermore, we use d \nthe NeuroDOT toolbox to implement  snirf2ndot , \nnirs2ndot, pre -processing, full -processing , and \nreconstruction  pipelines on OXI using Jupyter \nnotebooks wrapped in Docker containers. These \npipelines can be batch launched to do large -scale data processing in an efficient and repeatable manner and viewed \nvia output figures and Jupyter notebooks.  Additionally , we have created  tools to support uploading data to OXI, such \nas a BIDS structure validator, and single scan uploader , as well as tools to convert  downloaded data to BIDS.  \n \nConclusion:  Ongoing development of pipelines along with the open -source nature of the XNAT/OXI platform and \nNeuroDOT will support the growing needs of the fNIRS community.  Future work includes automated running of  \npipelines  and implementing  light modeling . We aim to make OXI synergistic with researchers’ workflow s and allow \nthem to leverage OXI ’s capabilities to the extent they see fit, while addressing the challenges of data standardization, \ndata sharing , and data processing throughout the entire scientific process.  \n \nReferences : \n1.

The module  is wearable and was built using  a consumer -grade  \nfitness tracker band . Unique features  of the device includ e a high sampling rate , an efficient noise -\ncanceling algorithm , and the ability to  simultaneous ly measure hemodynamic parameters and  heart \nrate. Continuous  monitoring  of tissue  blood content and oxygenation  was demonstrated  through a \nseries of in-vivo experiment s. This development holds promise for advancing noninvasive neonatal \nneuro monitoring in low-resource settings . \nIntroduction:  Infants in  limited -resources  regions  typically  face heightened risks of brain injury due to various \nadverse factors such as infections , malnutrition , and  lack of  adequate neuro monitoring tools . Near -infrared \nspectroscopy (NIRS) can monitor  cerebral blood content and oxygenation to detect early signs of neonatal brain injury ; \nhowever, current devices are not adequate for limited -resource s settings  [1]. The aim of this project  is to develop a \nlow-cost, frugal,  and wearable NIRS  cerebral oximeter  for monitoring neonatal cerebral blood oxygenation in low -\nresource settings . \nMethod: The electronics  of a widely available consumer -grade fitness  tracker band w ere used to develop  a compact , \nwearable, and low-cost NIRS cerebral  oximeter . The fitness track er band  (MAXM86146, Maxim Integrated) has \nwireless capabilities, is equipped with  two photodetectors , and can drive  four light-emitting diodes (LEDs) . Further, \nthe off-the-shelf  software that comes with the band  has robust  synchronization and effective noise -canceling \nalgorithm s, which enable real -time data acquisition and wireless data transfer to a computer . The LEDs of the module \nwere replaced by  two dual-wavelength LED s (SMT73 5D/850D, Marubeni) , emitting light at 73 5 and 850 nm. A \nflexible 3D-printed probe was designed to hold the LEDs and photodiodes  at 3 cm source -detector  separations  to \nenable deep tissue monitoring . Furthermore , all four  emitter -detector pairs were arranged in a symmetric geometry to \nenhance depth sensitivity by taking advantage  of the dual -slop data processing strategy  [2]. The ability of the module \nto measure tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) was illustrated  through a series  of forearm cuff occlusion experiment s in a \nhealthy adult . The device was secured over the subject’s flexor carpi radialis muscle, while a blood  pressure cuff was \nplaced on the upper arm of the participant. The data acquisition was conducted while the tissue went through three \nphysiological stages : 30 s baseline, 30 s artery/vein occlusion, and 60 s recovery. Concentrations of oxy- and deoxy -\nhemoglobin and StO 2 were  quantified over the measurement period based on the dual -slop approach  [2,3]. \nResults: As expected, StO 2 did not change during the baseline period, but gradually decreased upon occlusion of the \nforearm . After deflation of  the cuff, there was a sharp increase in the StO 2 with the expected hyperemia peak . In \naddition,  the high  sampling rate of the device enabl ed us to  monitor the heart rate throughout the experiment.  \nConclusion:  The feasibility of developing a  frugal  and wearable  NIRS  tissue oximeter  for real -time hemodynamic  \nmonitoring  was demonstrated . In addition to its affordability, the adaptable architecture of the module facilitates \ncustomization, allowing individuals in low -resource settings with minimal training to tailor and utilize the device \neffectively as a frugal  NIRS cerebral oximeter.  Moreover, the ability  of the device to monitor tissue blood oxygenation \nwas demonstrated , and f uture work  will include  a comprehensive evaluation of the device performance  using  tissue -\nmimicking phantoms and in-vivo experiments . \nThis project is funded by a Frugal Biomedical Innovation  Catalyst Grant , supported by Western University . \n[1] Rajaram, A., et al.

Yet, the choice of which channels to use in \nreconstruction is often ad hoc. We recently have shown that DOT-enhanced EEG reconstruction \nmay be improved using a data-informed method to select optimal channels for DOT reconstruction. \nHere we expand to two wavelengths to reconstruct hemoglobin changes and compare reconstruction \nof DOT priors using different DOT channels. We also study the effects of using optimized DOT \npriors on spatial resolution of EEG reconstruction by analyzing the full width half maximum of \nDOT-enhanced EEG reconstructions.  \n \nIntroduction:  Electroencephalography (EEG) has high temporal resolution, while diffuse optical tomography (DOT) \nhas high spatial resolution. Previous research has combined DOT and EEG to achieve high spatio-temporal resolution \nof reconstructed neural activity in the visual cortex [1]. We have also previously analyzed the effects of neural source \ndepth on the performance of DOT-enhanced EEG reconstruction in the auditory cortex. Since depth sensitivity—and \nconsequently the optimization of DOT channels—varies across wavelengths, we expanded the simulation to include \ntwo wavelengths, which allows us to reconstruct hemoglobin changes rather than absorption changes. Additionally, \nwe analyzed the effects of using optimized DOT priors on the spatial resolution of EEG reconstructions. \n \nMethods: We generated a 3D mesh of the human head. EEG and DOT forward models were implemented in FieldTrip \nand NIRFASTer respectively. Inverse modeling and combining DOT priors and EEG reconstruction solutions were \nfound using restricted maximum likelihood [1]. We simulated 29 optical sources and 29 detectors to cover the auditory \ncortex on the left hemisphere. We simulated DOT channels up to 70 mm at two wavelengths (750 nm and 850 nm). \nWe tested whether data-informed channel selection could achieve better depth sensitivity.  \n \nResults: Reconstructed oxyhemoglobin using all DOT channels shorter than 70 mm (Fig 1a) shows larger localization \nerror compared to optimized DOT channels (Fig. 1b).  For both noise-free (Fig. 1c) and noise-added (Fig. 1d) \nconditions, the full width half maximums of the reconstructed neural activity are significantly smaller using DOT \nreconstruction as the spatial prior for EEG reconstruction, corresponding to improved spatial resolution.  \n \nFig. 1 (a) Example of oxyhemoglobin changes using DOT channels shorter than 70 mm. (b) Example of oxyhemoglobin changes with selective \nchannel DOT. Green dot represents the ground truth simulated center of the neural source at the depth of 20 mm.

DOT-enhanced EEG reconstruction significantly increased the spatial resolution compared to \nEEG-only reconstruction while keeping the depth-sensitivity using data-informed selective channels method. Future \nwork will use high-density DOT (HD-DOT) to validate the data-informed selective channel DOT in experiment and \nto combine the HD-DOT with EEG for higher spatio-temporal resolution.  \n \nReferences:  1.

    "Impacts of Stress in Neuraland Cardiorespiratory\nResponses Induced by Time-RestrictedArithmetics\nL. F. Bortoletto1,2, G.G.Martins1and R. C. Mesquita1,2,3\n1Institute of Physics, University of Campinas, Campinas, SP , Brazil\n2Viva-Bem Hub, Artificial Intelligence Lab., Record.ai, Institute of Computing, University of Campinas, Brazil\n3School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom\nlfbort@ifi.unicamp.br\nAbstract: Stress at higher intensities can impair cognitive function and alter cardiorespiratory\ndynamics. In this work, we employed fNIRS and external physiological monitors to investigate\nhow time restriction affects human physiology during an arithmetics test in 60 participants. By\nquantifying brain activity and systemic physiology alterations to baseline, we found that (1) time\nrestriction elicited bigger changes in cardiorespiratory parameters, and (2) fNIRS brain activity\nmaps were more local during time restriction.\nIntroduction: Stress is a physiological response that disturbs homeostasis in the presence of a perceived threat.\nWhile moderate stress is natural, acute exposure to higher levels of stress can impair cognitive functions and lead to\nmental health issues [1,2]. Thus, understanding the impacts of stress on human physiology is valuable for\ndeveloping preventive care and health interventions. In this work, we combined functional Near-Infrared\nSpectroscopy (fNIRS) and cardiorespiratory monitoring to assess how stress, induced by time-restricted arithmetics,\naffects both neural and autonomic responses.\nMethods: This study enrolled 60 neurologically healthy participants (31 females; mean (standard deviation): 26 (8)\nyears). The setup comprised a NIRS system (NIRScout, NIRx Medical Technologies) with 62 long-separation\nchannels (~3 cm) and 6 short-separation channels (SC, ~8 mm), covering the frontal and parietal lobes. Additionally,\nvascular and respiratory parameters were recorded using a Finometer (Finapres) and a capnography system (G3C,\nGeneral Meditech), respectively. The paradigm consisted of a randomized block-design stimulation composed of 30\nto 40 seconds of simple arithmetic followed by 30 to 45 seconds of rest, repeated 15 times. In the first 5 blocks,\nparticipants performed calculations without time restriction. The time taken by the participant was used to establish\nthe initial time constraint for subsequent blocks, which was adjusted based on performance: if the participant scored\nmore (less) than 70% in a block, we reduced (increased) the time constraint for the following block. fNIRS data\nanalysis consisted of channel pruning (SNR < 8), motion correction [3], and band-pass filtering (0.005 – 0.5 Hz).\nNeural activation was inferred using a general linear model, which included a prewhitening filter to reduce\nautocorrelation [4]. Additionally, mean arterial pressure (MAP), exhaled CO2 curves, and SC time series were used\nas additional regressors after maximizing their cross-correlation (up to 10 seconds) to the hemoglobin time series.\nResults: Arithmetic performance was higher for the unlimited time condition compared to the time-restricted (90\n(8)% vs 57 (8)%, p<0.001). We observed an increase in MAP, heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) of 3.8 (0.8)\nmmHg, 4 (1) bpm and 2.7 (0.4) cpm when compared to baseline for time restriction. These changes were higher than\nthe ones observed with unlimited tasks for MAP (p < 0.001), HR (p = 0.026) and RR (p = 0.008). After considering\ncorrection from systemic physiology, arithmetics elicited brain activation bilaterally in the dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex, supplementary motor area and parietal cortex in both conditions. Pairwise comparison between both\nconditions showed a reduced recruitment of the middle frontal gyri and inferior parietal lobes during time restriction.\nConclusion: The higher increase in systemic physiology is consistent with a stronger activation of the sympathetic\nbranch of the autonomic nervous system, typical of stressful situations. The more local brain maps during time\nrestriction potentially reflect reduced integrative and working memory functions, due to lower task performance.\nReferences: 1. Marin, M. F., et al. (2011).

We tested a \nnovel functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) -based approach using an individualized \nmental -imagery task with short (2s) encoding periods. Nine participants simulated DoC states \nby either complying with the task or not. Employing Riemannian geometry on fNIRS data, we \nachieved 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in detecting compliance. This method proves \nfNIRS as a potential user -friendly diagnostic tool for DoC and Riemannian Geometry as a \npowerful decoding technique for bedside clinical applications.  \n  \nIntroduction:  Diagnosing DoC using behavioral assessments remains challenging in clinical settings.1 Up to 40% \nof patients in the minimally conscious state (M CS) have been inaccurately diagnosed as being in the veget ative \nstate (VS).2 FNIRS offers unique advantages for the bedside evaluation of DoC patients due to its portability and \nnon-invasiveness. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of brain -based diagnostic approaches, yet there \nremains a n eed for more effective diagnostic tools.3 \n  \nMethods: In a proof -of-principle study, we explored the feasibility and efficacy of a novel fNIRS -based bedside \ndiagnostic approach for DoC patients. After a short training session, nine healthy participants simu lated MCS and \nVS states by either complying with a mental imagery  task or not. This task involved a short 2 -s encoding period \nof individualized combined motor -language imagery. Using concepts from Riemannian geometry and EEG \nspatial -filtering approaches, we trained cla ssifiers based on the fNIRS -channel covariance matrices (combining \nHbO and HbR information) to classify participants' compliance or non -compliance with the task instructions.  \n  \nResults: Our covariance -based classification method achieved a group -mean accuracy of 83.89% (± 6.93%) \nduring compliance trials but remained, as expected, at chance level for non -compliance trials. On the individual \nlevel, we detected compliance to the task instructions with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89%. \nParticipants experienced active task performance as easy and pleasant indicating a high level of user -friendliness.  \n  \n \nConclusion:  The combination of our novel task -compliance \nparadigm, fNIRS, and an advanced analysis approach, has \nsignificant potenti al for clinical application.

Functional \nactivation analysis was used to localize active channels to use as seeds  for functional connectivity  \n(FC). Results show that PD patients exhibit lower functional connectivity than control participants \nduring the task with the dominant hand , suggesting  a neural basis for motor deficits in PD patients.  \nIntroduction:  fNIRS is increasingly used to study brain function in PD . It offers a portable and noninvasive  alternative \nto traditional imaging methods like fMRI and PET, which are limited by safety concerns and patient compatibility. \nThis research focuses on using fNIRS to quantify FC changes in brain networks in PD, aiding in understanding the \nneural correlates  of the disease.  \nMethods: Twenty patients with Parkinson's  disease PD  (United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank  criteria  [1]) and 20 \nage- and sex -matched healthy participants  performed left- (LFT)  and right -finger tapping task s (RFT) (20 10 -sec \nblocks with inter-stimuli time of 20 -24 sec) . Data was collected using an fNIRS system Brite MKII (Artinis Medical \nSystems BV, NL) with 757 and 843  nm wavelengths and  a sampling frequency of 25 Hz. Participants wore a  cap with \neight detectors and ten near -infrared sources; the probes were placed 3  and 1.5  cm apart to create  20 and 2 long and \nshort  separation channels , respectively . Raw data was converted into optical densities , motion -artifact corrected \n(spline) , band -pass filtered (0.01 -3 Hz), and then transformed into oxy- and deoxy -hemoglobin concentrations (HbO \nand HbR).  Systemic components were regressed from the Hb signals using the short -separation channels . Individual \nhemodynamic response functions (HRF) were estimated using a -2 to 25 s  time window  via a General Linear Model  \nwith consecutive series of 1-second -wide  Gaussian functions as basis functions . The seed -based FC analysis was \nconducted via  auto-regressive correlation [2] to obtain  all-to-all connectivity matrices . Then, we extracted  the R values  \nfrom a seed channel  to the rest of them . Finally, using HbO and HbR  jointly , we conducted a paired t -test over Fisher -\nZ transformed values to determine whether the seed -based connectivity differs  between control and PD groups . \nResults: Channels covering the left pars triangularis and right  postcentral gyrus  regions were significantly active \nduring RFT and LFT , respectively. The active channels  were selected as seeds  to determine left and right motor \nnetworks . Seed -based FC in the control  group showed more  contralateral connections to the seed channel, while PD \ngroup exhibited fewer  contralateral connections.  Significant difference s between control and PD groups  were found \nfor both conditions  LFT ( p-value <0.001, t=-5.01, dof=42 ) and RFT (p-value <0.01, t =-2.79, dof=42 ).

Although the depth of the placenta can be obtained using a secondary\nmodality like ultrasound to warn that a large depth may undermine the result, this is often not\navailable. Here, we show that the raw time point spread function from a TD-NIRS system can be\nused to predict the placental depth through a deep learning model. As a relatively small amount of\nraw training data was needed, the approach could be extended to other analysis applications.\nIntroduction: MAESTROS is a state-of-the-art in-house time-domain NIRS system with multiple source to detector\ndistances, capable of monitoring placental physiology with absolute quantification of oxygenation (oxy- deoxy-\nhaemoglobin) and mitochondrial metabolism (oxidation state of cytochrome-c-oxidase). However, if the placental\ndepth is too great, the reliability of the results may be affected. Here, a deep learning model is trained to estimate the\nplacental depth from the time point spread function (TPSF) immediately produced by the MAESTROS system,\nbefore any data processing to obtain physiological information.\nMethods: The MAESTROS system uses 4 source-to-detector distances (1,2,3,4 cm), while each detector measures\nNIR intensity at 16 wavelengths (equally spaced from 780 to 870 nm). Therefore, the raw TPSF data consists of 64\ndata channels which are continuously sampled in the time domain. For 128 scanned patients, a placental depth (skin\nto placental bottom) label was available as ultrasound scans were acquired and segmented for the original purpose of\ndeveloping simulations to optimise the device. A 1.1 GB neural network with two convolutional layers and two fully\nconnected layers was trained to predict placental depth from the 64 data channels, averaged over 30 TPSF time\nwindows (see figure 1) acquired in 60 seconds. Training data augmentation involved adding gaussian noise (s.d. 1%\nmax intensity), random phase shifts in the time domain (s.d. 100 us), and random dropout of 25% of the channels.\nFigure 1: Left: The average TPSF measured by the first detector during an NIRS scan. The data within the yellow time window,\nand from the same window from the other three detectors, was used as the raw input data to train the model.\nCentre: Ultrasound scans acquired just before NIRS were segmented to obtain the placental depth to use as training labels.\nRight: The result when the model was applied to unseen test cases data, showing a correlation between the labelled placental\ndepth and the model prediction, with the linear fit (pink line) shown to be similar to the ideal relationship (grey line).\nResults:The model predicted placental depth in 20 test cases with a mean absolute error of 1.51 cm (see figure 1).\nConclusion: The model could be used to alert the MAESTROS operators early in the acquisition if the placental\ndepth is too great to obtain reliable results, or other placenta monitoring devices with a maximum depth tolerance.\nThe model is likely to become more accurate as more training data is acquired. Its architecture may also be part of a\nclassifier for pregnancy complications to be developed in future work, allowing the raw data to be combined with\nphysiological features in the processed data.\n265 of 398",
    "The Role of Social Interaction in Children’s Learning of \nAbstract Concepts: an fNIRS Hyperscanning Study.  \nGal Rozica, Sara De Feliceb,c, Antonia Hamiltonb, Gabriella Viglioccoa \naDepartment of Experimental Psychology, University College London, London, UK , bInstitute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College  \nLondon, London, UK , cDepartment of Psychology, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK , Presenting Author email: gal.rozic.20@ucl.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  Learning abstract concepts  usually occurs within social interactions , but the underlying \nmechanisms remain unknown. This study investigates how children learn abstract concepts in \nnaturalistic  interactions with their caregivers , through a novel  interactive and multimodal design . \nUsing fNIRS hyperscanning, we analyse brain -to-brain synchronisation ( with Wavelet Transform \nCoherence  analysis ) and dyadic  verbal behavio urs (e.g., question -answer, turn -taking)  to identify \nneural and behavioural coordination patterns that predict successful learning. This study will \nenhance our understanding of brain -behavior interplay in ecological social interactions fostering \nchildren’s learning of  abstract concept s.  \nIntroduction:  The context of social interaction is a rich ground for multimodal behaviours and brain activity that \ndynamically coordinate between those engaged to support successful communication1. This interpersonal exchange \nrepresents the ecological niche where learni ng concepts typically occurs over the lifespan, starting with  the children \nand caregiver  interactions2. Previous research has  mainly focused on the learner, overlooking how learning occurs in \nreal-world interactions. This  context  may be particularly import ant for abstract concepts  which, given their immaterial \nnature, may especially rely on interactive dynamics of face -to-face communication,  both in terms of behavioural \ncoordination and neural synchronisation3. This study aims to characterise the behavioural and neural coordinative \ndynamics that underlie primary -school -aged children’s abstract concept learning in interaction with caregivers.  \nMethods: We present an  ongoing multimodal  fNIRS hyperscanning study, where caregivers and their 8 to 9 -year-old \nchildren take part in a novel, interactive concept learning task.  To date, 2 4 dyads have taken part  (from a target  sample \nof 30). The primary aim is to build  a dataset of brain and behavioural measures  to identify significant predictors of \nsuccessful learning. Conceptual learning is assessed by evaluating children’s comprehension as well as their  ability to \ngeneralise knowledge to new real -world situations. Additionally, we present  an unprecedented pipeline for verbal \nanalysis integrating  AI-based  speech transcription and automatic annotation of coordinative verbal behaviours , namely  \nquestion -answer, turn -taking  and backchannelin g (Figure 1A) . With these  data, we build a linear mixed effect \nregressio n model to identify the specific behaviours contributing to abstract concept learning. To measure brain \nactivity , we use the Hitachi ETG4000 NIRS device with a 5x3 probe of 22 channels (8 sources, 7 detectors) for each \nmember of the dyad. We focus on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction, key regions involved \nin social cognition, language and learning.  Using Wavelet Transform Coherence analysis across successful learning \ntrials and those that do not result in learning, our study w ill uncover whether and when brain -to-brain synchronisation \nbetween caregivers and children  predicts successful learning  on the above -mentioned regions of interest  (Figure 1B) . \nExpected Results: Behaviourally, we hypothesise that key coordinative behaviours  (i.e., question -answers, \nbackchanneling , turn-taking ), which have been previously found to be relevant in face -to-face communication, predict \nabstract concept learning. Neurally , we hypothesise that \ninter-brain synchrony will contribute to successful \nlearning, although the pattern may not be linear and \nmay b e modulated by the behaviours of the dyad.  \nConclusion:  As we take an embodied approach to \nsocial neuroscience by simultaneously considering the \nbehavioural coordination and brain -to-brain \nsynchronisation of the interactive dyad  as predictors of   \nlearning , this study will enhance our understanding of  \nthe interplay between brain and behaviour within \necological social interactions that support childhood \nabstract concept acquisition.  \nReferences:  [1] De Felice, S., Hamilton, A.

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA \nb Neurophotonics Center, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States \nc Division of Newborn Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States \nEmail: notic@mgh.harvard.edu \nAbstract: Monitoring cerebral metabolism, in addition to hemodynamics, can provide valuable \ninsight into the brain health of infants. Cytochrome C Oxidase (CCO) is a key component of the \nelectron transport chain inside mitochondria and is responsible for 95% of oxygen utilization. As \nsuch, it is a valuable biomarker of cerebral metabolism. We have redesigned our wearable, wireless, \nand portable cerebral oximeter, FlexNIRS, to include 8-wavelength light-emitting diodes (LEDs) \n(735-910 nm), which allows us to simultaneously measure changes in hemoglobin, as well as CCO \nconcentration. We are currently validating the device on blood-yeast-intralipid liquid phantoms and \nhuman adults and will show results. \nIntroduction: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the leading causes of mortality in neonates and \ncontributes greatly to disability. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the only standard treatment of HIE. The gold \nstandard for assessing brain injury after hypoxia-ischemia is magnetic resonance spectroscopy, however, assessments \naren’t made until 72 hours after TH treatment. As such, there is a need for brain health biomarkers to allow clinicians \nto make bedside decisions to improve outcome.  Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an established in-hospital \nmodality to monitor brain oxygenation status. CCO is a key member in the electron transport chain inside mitochondria \nand is responsible for 95% of oxygen utilization on a cellular level1. Simultaneous NIRS measurements of hemoglobin \nconcentration (Hb), hemoglobin oxygenation (SO 2), and oxCCO provide complementary information on brain \nhemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism important for the assessment of response to TH therapy in real-time.  \nMethods:  To recover oxCCO changes we modified the FlexNIRS,2 to include two custom 8-wavelength LEDs to \nuniformly cover the Hb and CCO absorption spectra from 735 to 910 nm. The device uses a more powerful analog \nfront-end (AFE 4460) module with respect to the original FlexNIRS, to successfully multiplex eight instead of two \nwavelengths, and a Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 microcontroller. The MW-FlexNIRS uses the same self-calibrating \ncross-symmetric geometry and is encapsulated in medical grade silicone elastomer to allow for continuous monitoring \nof an infant’s hemodynamics. To validate the system ability to distinguish changes in Hb and oxCCO we performed \nsimultaneous measurements on blood-intralipid-yeast phantoms. \nResults: We show preliminary data from an absorption titration \nperformed using an ink-intralipid phantom, where we added \nprogressive amounts of ink, such that the change in absorption for \neach step is similar to the change in absorption caused by oxCCO \nand compare it to a reference frequency domain NIRS device. \nResults obtained on blood-yeast-intralipid phantoms and \npreliminary performances in humans will be shown at the \nconference. \n1) Bale G., et al.

    "Neural and Behavioral Co -Regulation a mong Mothers and \ntheir Toddlers : A Hyperscanning Study  \n \nLindsay Taraban, Ph.D., Katie Mowatt, B.S., & Judith K. Morgan, Ph.D.  \n \nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh; Loeffler Building , Pittsburgh, PA 15213  \nlet42@pitt.edu  \n \nAbstract:  This study tested how behavioral co -regulation between mothers and their toddler s \nrelated to brain -to-brain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex  (PFC) and temporoparietal junction \n(TPJ ). Behavioral co -regulation and neural synchrony were measured during mother -child face -to-\nface play. Higher levels of behavioral co -regulation were associated with  greater neural synchrony \nin maternal left TPJ and child right TPJ ( t = 2.80, p = .006) and in maternal left TPJ and child left \ndorsolateral PFC ( t = 2.48, p = .01).  Results suggest that greater observed behavioral co -regulation \nis supported by higher levels of brain -to-brain synchrony in regions relevant f or emotional \nunderstanding and regulation . \n \nIntroduction : Through the process of co -regulation, children and their caregivers coordinate behavioral, affective, \nand physiological signals that over time support the child’s ability to self-regulate.1 Recent advancements in \nneuroimaging technology, specifically , the use of  in-vivo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), have made it possible to \nexamine the neural mechanisms that underlie parent -child co -regulation.2 The current study tested how behavioral co -\nregulation between mothers and their toddler -age children related to neural co -regulation  (i.e., neural synchrony)  in \nthe prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ).  \nMethods: Participants were 90 mothers and their 1 - to 3-year-old children (mean age  = 24.9 months SD = 10.2 months;  \n53% boys). Behavioral co -regulation was measured during 10 minutes of mother -child floor play and coded using the \nCIB system .3 Neural co -regulation was measured during 3 minutes of face -to-face play using a continuous -wave CW6 \nNIRS system (TechEn , Milford, MA ). Fiber optics were split between two caps worn by both members of the dyad, \nwhich allowed for simultaneous measurement of mother and child brain activities  (i.e., hyperscanning) . NIRS data \nwere analyzed using the AnalyzIR toolbox.4 \nResults: Higher levels of behavioral co -regulation were associated with greater neural  synchrony  in mom left TPJ and \nchild right TPJ ( t = 2.80, p = .006) and in m om left TPJ and child left dorsolateral PFC ( t = 2.48, p = .01 ; Figure 1.  \nConclusion : Behavioral co -regulation may be  supported by higher levels of brain -to-brain synchrony in regions \nrelevant for emotional understanding and regulation.5,6 Additional analyses will examine associations between neural \nco-regulation and other behavioral indices of the mother -child relationship, such as maternal sensitivity, as well as \nmaternal predictors of neural and behavioral co -regulation, including matern al economic and social stress.  \n \nReferences  \n1.

    "Comparison of Functional Intraoperative Optical and Pre-\noperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Resting-state and \nTask-based Procedures\nAdithep Kawinkij1, Charly Caredda1, Thiébaud Picart3, Jacques Guyotat3, Eric Van \nReeth1, Fabien C.

Université Jean Monnet Saint Etienne, CHU de Saint Etienne, TAPE Research Unit EA 7423, F-42023, Saint Etienne, France,\n3. Service de Neurochirurgie D, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Bron, France\nadithep.kawinkij@creatis.insa-lyon.fr\nAbstract:  Functional  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (fMRI)  and  Functional  Optical  Imaging \n(fRGB) are method of identifying functional brain region, preoperatively and intraoperatively, \nrespectively. Each method contains two procedural modes: task-based and resting-state. Unlike \ntask-based  imaging,  resting-state  imaging  does  not  require  patient  intervention  which  may \nfacilitate  functional  identification  during  neurosurgery.  Thus,  we  evaluated  the  capability  of \nidentifying brain function using intraoperative resting-state fRGB by comparing the functional \nareas to those identified using fMRI. For nine patients with gliomas, the fMRI data was projected \nonto the fRGB optical space, and we compared the activated regions using DICE and overlap \ncoefficients.\nIntroduction:  Functional  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (fMRI)  is  a  preoperative  gold  standard  to  identify \nfunctional brain area and can be used for operation risk assessment[1]. On the other hand, Functional Optical Imaging \n(fRGB) permits the identification in the intraoperative setting[2]. Both methods have two modes of procedure: task-\nbased (tb-fMRI and tb-fRGB) and resting-state (rs-fMRI and rs-fRGB). Task-based procedure allows the localized \nidentification of brain area, but requires patient intervention. Resting-state procedure, however, can be performed \nwithout patient intervention and is practical for patients who are unable to perform tasks or under anesthesia. \nTherefore, we would like to evaluate the feasibility and capability of using rs-fRGB during neurosurgery for \nidentifying brain functions by comparing the functional areas with ones from tb-fRGB, tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI.\nMethods: The fRGB and fMRI data were collected from nine patients with low- or high-grade gliomas from the \nHospices Civils de Lyon and the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Étienne with both task-based and resting-\nstate procedures. For task-based acquisitions, the motor cortex was stimulated by repetitive hand opening and \nclosing with 3 to 4 alteration blocks of rest and movement. Each block is with 20 seconds duration for tb-fRGB, and  \n30 seconds for tb-fMRI. The resting-state acquisitions were performed with the patient at rest with a duration of 3 \nminutes for rs-fRGB, and 10 minutes for rs-fMRI. The fMRI acquisitions were performed using 1.5T or 3T MR  \nimaging scanner. The resting-state data was then processed using Independent Component Analysis and seed-based \nanalysis. We projected the fMRI estimated brain activity onto the fRGB space, and we compared the activated \nregions from rs-fRGB to tb-fRGB and to the projected tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI using overlap and DICE coefficients [2].\nResults: The preliminary results from one of the patients shows that the comparison of rs-fRGB and tb-fRGB \nsuggests an agreement with DICE = 0.81, and overlap = 0.76 (over the tb-fRGB). Similarly, the tb-fRGB and tb-\nfMRI shows a correspondence with DICE = 0.75, and overlap = 0.67 (over the projected tb-fMRI), see Figure 1. The  \nsame data processing is to be performed for rs-fRGB to rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI, and to all of the patients.\nReferences: 1. Schneider, F. C. et al. AJNR Am J Neuroradiol  37 (2016),\n2.

    "Speaking and Listening  Online to Live and Static Faces  \nU. Hakima, N.Gunasekaraa, J.A. Noahb, X. Zhangb, A. Hamiltonc, I. Tachtsidisa, J. Hirschb \na Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL, UK  \nb Yale School of Medicine, Yale University  \nc Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL, UK  \nPresenting Author email address: uzair.hakim.17@ucl.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  Video calling  use has increased over the last 5 years. As this  interaction grows , \nunderstanding differences  in brain function in this space is important.  We present functional \nactivation and IBC results from an online hyperscanning speaking -listening task, using either live -\ndynamic or static face presentations. Increased rTPJ activity  was found  during live face conditions \nand dorsal stream when including fac ial expressions as a co -regressor. Wernicke’s area was \nprimarily active when observing live -faces during listening compared to static -faces. IBC was \nexamined by including data from partners rTPJ as co -regressor in GLMs  and the lTPJ was found to \nbe active.  \nIntroduction:  In online communications the live -video feed can be displayed and observers can gain social \ninformation from facial expressions, along with verbal communication. Alternatively, their live feed can be replaced \nby a static image, removing visual information.  In this study, we will present findings from a pilot study  acquiring \ndata simultaneously from labs at UCL and Yale,  examining the effects of varying face information on neural systems \nassociated with language perception, aswell as face processing systems.  To analyse the IBC cross -brain (x)GLM is \napplied to test the Mutual Prediction  (MP)  framework (Kingsbury et al. , 2019) . We hypothesized that the rTPJ will \nbe active when observing live faces vs static, and the dorsal stream will be active  when face information is included.  \nSimilar  to (Hirsch et al. , 2018) , we expect Wernicke’s /Broca’s area to show increased activity when participants \nlisten/speak to live faces vs static reflecting increased interactivity of live faces. Finally, based on previous work \nexamining the MP framework using xGLM (Cañigueral et al. , 2021) , we hypothesize d that the inclusion of rTPJ data \nfrom participants partners will primarily activ ate the lDLPFC of each participant.  Methods: 10 participants  (5 pairs)  \ntook part in a verbal communication paradigm. Participants spoke or listened for 15 s. Prior to the speaking period a \n5s prompt was shown.  Roles were reversed after each block.  Each participant would speak/listen for 3 blocks per run  \nlasting 3.5 minutes. In 4 runs the partners live face was shown and in 4 a static face was shown. Data collection \nbetween locations was synchronized using a method developed in Python and previously presented. fNIRS data was \nacquired from both participants using  Shimadzu LABNIRS with 134 channels. ECG, respiration, eye -tracking and \nface expressions were acquired at both sites. Analysis was conducted using the GLM approach.  Face movements were \nprocess ed with the eye -tracking data using custom MATLAB scripts so that only face movements which were \nobserved by participants were included. These were included in the GLM as parametric regressors reflecting \nobservable face information. This was extended to the IBC computation by conducting xGLMs, and including data \nfrom the rTPJ of each participant ’s partner as a co -regressor, alongside categorical and parametric regressors. \nStatistical analyses were conducted using t -tests. Results: Results are shown in Fig.1  thresholded at p<0.05, \nuncorrected . (a) left are results from live vs static. As hypothesized the rTPJ is active. The right panel of (a) is with \nthe inclusion of the face information parametric regressor, as \nhypothesized the dorsal stream of face processing is active. (b) \nleft compares live -talking to static -talking, we hypothesized that \nBroca’s area would be more active here, however this was not \nfound. (b)  right  shows live -listening vs static -listening. The \nresults show increased activity in Wernicke’s area, as \nhypothesized. (c) shows the  IBC analysis , examining live vs \nstatic . We hypothesized that the lDLPFC would be active, \nhowever the lTPJ was primarily active . Conclusion:  We present \nfindings from verbal communication online with varying levels \nof face information. Results indicate that level of face information \nmodulates the neural activity associated with the receptive \nlanguage system (Wernicke’s area).  The rTPJ is associated with \nmanagement of social behaviour, results from the IBC analysis \nshow that this is linked with the lTPJ of pa rtners, suggesting that \nthe prediction of social behaviour of a partner is linked to the \nmanagement of the partners social behaviour.  \nCañigueral, R. et al.

    "How Lipstick Texture Deviations are Associated with the Right \nPrefrontal Cortex  Activation  \nKazue Hirabayashia,b, Keith Kawabata Duncana, Keiko Tagaia, Yasushi Kyutokub, and \nIppeita Danb \n \na MIRAI Technology Institute, Shiseido Co., Ltd . \n1-2-11 Takashima Nishi -ku Yokohama Kanagawa 220 -0011, Japan  \nb Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Chuo University  \n1-13-27 Kasuga Bunkyo -ku Tokyo 112 -8551, Japan  \nPresenting Author email address: kazue.hi rabayashi@shiseido.com  \n \nAbstract:  This study employed fNIRS to investigate consumer experiences with cosmetics, \nfocusing on the incongruency between  lipstick  softness and consumer expectations. Thirty frequent  \nlipstick users evaluated and rated six different lipsticks with varying softness levels while their brain \nactivity was recorded  with fNIRS . The results indicated that incongruency in softness reduced \nwillingness to pay and increased activation in the righ t inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) based on intra -\nsubject correlation analysis. These findings suggest that fNIRS can detect real -time product \nexperience discrepancies, offering a novel neuromarketing approach to enhance product \ndevelopment and potentially und erstand the neural basis of luxury perception, providing brands with \na competitive advantage.  \n \nIntroduction:  There is a continuous consumer demand for ever superior cosmetic products. Various sensory \nevaluation  methods  are used to measure the consumer experience and provide data to improve cosmetics. Nonetheless, \npotential downsides of existing approaches have led to the exploration of the use of neuroimaging methods, such as \nfNIRS to provide addition information about consumers’ experiences of cosmetics  Thus, t he aim of the present study \nwas to investigate the feasibility of a real -time brain -based product evaluation method which detects the incongruency \nof a product, in this case lipstick and its texture, compared to a  consumer’s expectations.    \n \nMethods: Thirty healthy, right -handed, Japanese female participants (average age: 29.8 years, SD: 3.7, range: 25 -35) \nwere asked to apply six different lipsticks, varying in softness, and to record their perceived softness rati ngs and \nwillingness to pay (WTP) based on the valuation on their softness preferences. The time series of their cerebral \nhemodynamic responses in frontal areas during lipstick application were measured with fNIRS and analyzed using \nthe general linear model  (GLM). Incongruency scores of softness were calculated in order to understand how far \nremoved each lipstick was from optimal softness. The correlation between beta scores during the application of each \nlipstick and the respective incongruency scores from each participant were acquired u sing semi -partial correlation \nanalysis, controlling for the effects of WTP.  \n \nResults: We revealed a significant intra-subject correlatio n \nbetween incongruency scores and activation in  multiple areas  \n(Figure 1) . Only Ch 8 had a reasonable type -I error threshold under \na power threshold of 0.8 with a presumed effect size over d > 0.5  \n(mean Z = 0.31 , SEM = 0.51 , [t(26) = 3.15, p<0.01, d = 0.6 1]). Ch \n8 covered  the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This finding \nconfirms that as the texture incongruency scores increased for the \nlipstick samples, activation in individual’s right IFG also \nincreased.  \n \nConclusion:  The correlation observed between incongruency and \nactivation of the right IFG not only suggests that the right IFG may \nplay an important role in detecting incongruity when there is a discrepancy between the perceived texture and the \nconsumer's expectations  but also that the measurement of activity in the IFG may provide useful information and help \ndevelop a new measurement of consumer experience, contributing to the development of superior cosmetics.   \nFigure 1: Intra -subject correlation between \nall 52 channels and the incongruency score  \n271 of 398",

The graphic interface includes the \ntimeseries, montage, correlation matrix, Fourier transform, and temporal autocorrelations. When \nloading multiple datasets, the app streamlines navigation both (a) across acquisition runs and (b) \nacross processing steps within an acquisition run.  This facilitates visual inspection of both the \ndataset at large as well as of the step-by-step effects of the processing pipeline. The application  is \nintended for identifying issues and verifying processing  outputs  regardless of the toolbox (es) used.  \nSurfNIRS is undergoing active development  and feedback is very much welcome d. \nIntroduction:  Current best practices  emphasize the importance of looking at the data during each step of processing. \nThis visual inspection serves an important purpose both in identifying potential issues and in verifying that the \nprocessing steps  had the intended effect . While many  toolboxes  do include visualizations, these are generally limited  \nwith regard to (a) the information displayed, (b) the clarity and screen space allocated to visualizations, (c) the ability \nto quickly  compare across processing steps, and (d) the supported data formats.  SurfNIRS  is a comprehensive solution \nto visual inspection  that aims to address these limitations.  \nMethods: SurfNIRS is a  dedicated data viewer for fNIRS built as a  MATLAB Application . The interface is clean \nand intuitive (e.g., hovering the cursor over data in one panel highlights the corresponding data in  all other panels).  \nBIDS simplifies the data selection  and import process but is not a strict requirement.  The app organizes datasets by \nboth acquisition run and processing step to facilitate navigation across either dimension.  The code  is open source \nand is also available as a standalone executable  for those without  a MATLAB license.  Note that output from each \nprocessing step must be stored to later view in SurfNIRS , which may require workflow changes . \nResults: SurfNIRS  v0.1 was released in April 2024 and contains all core features including  support for AnalyzIR’s \n“nirs.core.Data ” format.  Leading up to September 2024, quality of life features will be implemented , and support will \nbe extended to include at minimum : SNIRF, Homer3, and FANBIDS. Documentation will also be added  to GitHub  \nduring this time.  Following September 2024, additional features will be introduced  based  on interest  and these  will \nlikely prioritize  quality control  (e.g., montage channels colour -coded by SCI).  \nConclusion:  SurfNIRS is available now at the link above .

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA,  \n 2Division of Neurocritical Care, Department of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, \n3Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.  \namuldoon@mgh.harvard.edu  \nAbstract:  We present data from long -term continuous  optical  monitoring  of a patient with \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage , a rare medical condition  requiring treatment in intensive care  to prevent \nbrain damage from complications such as vasospasm. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) data \nwas collected at three separations , and clinical data including ECG  data and arterial blood pressure  \nwere  collected from clinical monitors . Drug administration times were collected from the medical \nrecord. We show that DCS is a viable method for long-term continuous bedside  monitoring and, \nbased on treatment -induced physiological changes , that systemic blood pressure is not a suitable \nsurrogate marker for brain blood flow.  \nIntroduction:  Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a rare [1], serious medical condition caused by rupture \nof a cerebral aneurysm, resulting in bleeding between the brain and dura mater. Symptoms present as a severe headache \nfollowed by seizures and stroke -like s ymptoms. Rapid medical treatment in intensive care is needed to reduce risks of \nlong-term brain damage; however, complications can still arise days after initial symptoms. A common complication \nis vasospasm – constriction of cerebral blood ve ssels – reducing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and potentially causing \nischemic injury [2]. Currently, there are no methods for measuring CBF or detecting vasospasm suitable for continuous \nlongitudinal monitoring, potentially delaying treatment. We present data using diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) \nto monitor a patient with SAH at the MGH Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit (NeuroICU) for 18 days.  \nMethods:  Blood flow was measured using an 8 -channel interferometric DCS system set up at the patient’s bedside in \nthe NeuroICU. DCS detector fibers were located 5, 25, and 30 mm away from the source, respectively. Auxiliary \nchannels on the DCS systems were used to capture high temporal resolution physiologic data (ECG and ABP). A three -\naxis accelerometer was used to record patient motions. At least once per 24 -hour period, the probe was removed from \nthe patient to check for skin irritation and replaced on t he forehead as close as possible to its previous position. \nAutocorrelation functions were averaged for 10 seconds before being fit for blood flow index values. Administration \ntimes of vasoactive drugs were retrieved from the patient’s electronic medical record.  \nResults: The below figure shows comparisons of group averaged responses to three different  medications  at different \ntimepoints during treatment. Note that  blood flow changes do not always correlate with MAP changes and that  \nresponses to a given intervention may vary at different timepoints.  \n \nConclusion:  We demonstrate DCS as a viable technique for continuous long -term bedside monitoring of CBF. We \nused DCS to acquire data for 18 days, capturing multiple treatment -induced physiological changes. Further, we \nobserved that these changes may have conflicting effects on blood pressure and CBF, showing ina dequacy of MAP as \na marker for brain perfusion. DCS shows promise as a tool for hemodynamic management of SAH patients.  \nReferences  \n1. D. Chung  et al., “Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,”  Neurol. Clin ., 39(2), 419 -442 (2021).  \n2. S.

We show \npreliminary results using a sparse array system then describe our high -density array design.  \n \nIntroduction:  Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an important indicator of brain function , and its  monitoring would benefit \nmany clinical settings, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, and encephalopathies [1]. Speckle \ncontrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) has recently been introduced as  a more affordable approach  to measuring CBF  \nusing  CCD/CMOS cameras to detect multiple speckles at a time  thereby improving  the signal to noise ratio. We have \npreviously shown that we can  measure human CBF changes at large  (>30 mm)  source -detector separations ( SDSs) \nwith a pulsed laser setup and noise correction methods [2].  However, the use of multiple sources and detectors to  \ncreate  a map of CBF changes have not yet been shown. Here we present our first map of human brain activation \ninduced CBF changes measured through a multi -channel SCOS system and our ongoing development of the high \ndensity, multi -channel SCOS system.  \n \nMethods: Laser from  VHG  stabilized laser diode (852 nm  l) is collimated, steered with two galvanometer mirrors, \nthen refocused with an achromatic lens (50 mm FL) onto a  linear array of multi -mode fibers 250 um apart (0.22 NA, \n62.5 um diameter)  (fig 1a) . Each  detector fiber bundle (0.66 NA, 37 um core diameter, ~3700 fibers) project the  \nspeckle patterns magnified with a 4f system  onto a commercial CMOS camera (Basler a2A1920 -160umPRO).  The \ngalvanometer illuminates each source fiber for 4 ms, followed by 6 ms at rest location.  Fundamental contrast squared \n(Kf2), the inverse of blood flow index (BFi), is calculated by subtracting various noise contributions from each 7x7 \npixel window’s r aw contrast squared (K raw2), then taking the \nmean across windows . One 19 mm SDS BFi time course is \nlinearly regressed to extract cerebral BFi (cBFi). Activation  \ninduced cBFi  change was measured while a subject was \ngiven serial mental subtraction task for 20 seconds followed \nby rest time of 20 -25 seconds for 5 trials.  \n \nResults: Sparse array (fig  1b) measurement show  localized \nchange in cBFi of up to 20% with mental subtraction induced \ncerebral activation  (fig 1c). With high density array (fig 1 d), \nwe show  consistent cardiac BFi time courses for most \nchannels with SDS < 50 mm  (fig 1e) . \n \nConclusion:  We show feasibility of high -density, multi -\nchannel SCOS system through successful measurement of \nmental subtraction induced cBFi increase in sparse array \nsystem, followed by high -density measurement of cardiac \nBFi time courses across channels with SDS < 50  mm. We \nplan to conduct cognitive tasks with the high -density system  \nand create a high resolution cBFi activation map.  \n \n1. Tzeng Y -C, Ainslie PN : Eur J Appl Physiol.  114, \n545. (2014)  \n2.

We describe a novel classification \nsystem used to create knowledge generation and training materials along with the steps taken to \nimprove the accessibility of the NeuroDOT toolbox for the global fNIRS community. \nIntroduction : The increasing interest in fNIRS research over the past 30 years[1] has led to the development of multiple \ntoolboxes[2-4] for the processing and analysis of optical neuroimaging data, motivating informative and accessible \ndocumentation and training materials. In NeuroDOT[2], we emphasize  interpretable and accessible training materials \nfor researchers that come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experience levels. Documentation in NeuroDOT \nincludes tutorials, comments in each function, and targeted workshops at institutions and conferences.  \nMethods: We approach creating documentation with three \ncriteria in mind: intent – the use case, readability – ease of \nunderstanding, and accessibility – ease of use and access . We \nuse four non-mutually exclusive categories ( Figure 1), to help \nclassify documentation given the primary purpose – Learning, \nProblem-Solving, Understanding, and Informing – to allow for \na more streamlined training material creation process. For \nexample, NeuroDOT tutorials primarily fall under “Learning” \nand usually have another classification based on their purpose, \nfor example, the Data Organization tutorial would be \nadditionally classified as “Understanding” and the Data \nVisualization Tutorial would additionally be classified as \n“Problem Solving. ” We apply the same approach to the Python \ntoolbox by developing the tutorials in Jupyter Notebooks that \ncombine the best parts of tutorial PowerPoint and MATLAB \nscripts.  \nResults: NeuroDOT Tutorials built as PowerPoint slides guide \nthe user through paired MATLAB scripts and provide examples of specific aspects of the toolbox from individual \nprocessing pipelines to data organization. Code comment sections provide details about inputs, outputs, and tunable \nparameters, along with a brief description of each function’s intended use. Workshops allow users to explore the \ntoolbox in a hands-on environment with members of the development team present to answer questions and provide \none-on-one assistance. Increasing the accessibility of the toolbox through the Python version allows us to reach \nresearchers w ho prefer an open-source programming language, as opposed to a costly MATLAB license. \nConclusion: As the field of optical brain mapping increases in size and scope, the demand for tools to manipulate, \nanalyze, and visualize that data also increases. We take a user focused approach to creating materials for NeuroDOT \nthat any interested potential researcher, regardless of experience, can use to incorporate our tools into their projects.  \nFuture efforts will focus on expanding upon existing tutorials as the code base for NeuroDOT grows along with \ncreating new tutorials centered on post-processing and more advanced uses of the toolbox. We plan to increase the \nnumber of workshops held and outreach to our global community of fellow researchers. Documentation and training \nmaterials will also be built for OXI, our cloud based platform for data storage, sharing, and processing.  \nReferences: \n[1] Pinti et al., The present and future use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for cognitive neuroscience, 2018.

    "Voxel-wise modeling of naturalistic auditory stimuli using \nvery-high-density diffuse optical tomography  \n \nMorgan Fogarty1*, Wiete Fehner1, Aahana Bajracharya1, Jerry Tang2, Zachary E. Markow1, Jason \nTrobough1, Alexander  G. Huth2, Joseph P. Culver1 \n \n1Washington University  in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO , USA, 2The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA   \n*Presentation Contact / Corresponding Author Email: m.fogarty@wustl.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Language is represented across the cortex in regions known as the semantic system.  These \nregions are extensively mapped  with fMRI and provide the foundation for semantic decoding . Here, \nwe establish  voxel -wise modeling  of narrative stories using semantic features with very high -density \ndiffuse optical tomography  (VHD-DOT) . Using this model, we predict ed voxel responses to a held -\nout story  and validated it against collected data. We found our model to be selective for semantic \nregions, providing evidence that VHD-DOT can successfully map, and decode narrative stimuli.   \n \nIntroduction:  Functional neuroimaging u sing naturalistic stimuli  has led to mapping  visual semantic  (Huth et al., \n2012)  and linguistic semantic  (Huth et al., 2016)  representations  across the cortex. These representations, or encoding \nmodel s, lay the groundwork for  semantic decoding  (Tang et al., 2023). Promising applications of this work include \nmapping semantic deficits in subjects with aphasia, and decoding the language a person intends to produce, for use as \na brain -computer interface. However, currently most semantic encoders rely on fMRI, which prohibits use outside the \nlaboratory setting. Alternatively, diffuse optical tomography \n(DOT) can act as a  surrogate for  fMRI  with potential \nadvantages of  portability and wearability . Here, we develop \nthe usage of very-high-density  DOT for semantic  auditory  \nbrain mapping using engaging autobiographical  podcasts . \nMethods: Data were collected from  a  healthy control \nparticipant as they listened  to 10, 10 -15 minute  stories from \nthe Moth Radio Hour  podcast  over two imaging sessions.  A \n10-minute validation story was repeated once per session.  \nVoxel -wise encoding followed methods in (Huth et al., 2016) . \nSemantic features from the stimulus stories were extracte d \nusing a word co -occurrence  semantic model. Features were \nconcatenated  across all stories and time -delayed to create a \nlinear finite impulse response model for estimating the \nhemodynamic response function  (3940 features total) . Ridge  \nregression was used to estimate the feature weights for each \nvoxel . Bootstrapping was used to select a single regularization \ncoefficient for all voxels.  We evaluated the model by using it \nto predict  the responses of each voxel to a held -out story. \nVoxel -specific semantic feature  timecourses  were estimated by simulating how a voxel would respond to individual \nwords using the encoding model weights, and selecting the most preferred words.  Correlation between  predicted  and \nmeasured responses  of the  validation story were computed  to judge accuracy.  \nResults: Explained variance over auditory cortex, between repeated validation stories that were either matched (Fig \n1A), or mismatched (Fig 1B), verifies  that neural responses are unique to each story. These maps, and the single voxel \ntimetraces for the largest explained variance voxel ( Fig 1C), indicate that cap placement was consistent between \nimaging sessions. High correlation regions between the predicted and  collected HD -DOT responses  (Fig 1D) align \nwith semantic regions including the lateral temporal cotex, superior prefrontal cortex,  and temporal parietal junction.  \nA histogram of the correlations ( Fig 1E) indicates that voxels skew towards  larger correlations . Word s related to the \nhighest correlation voxel included “ victims”, “protect”, “traitor”, “threatened”, and “ justice”, indicating that  this voxel \nresponds to words related to conflict or harm.  \nConclusion:  This lays the groundwork for semantic brain mapping using an engaging, naturalistic auditory stimulus. \nPreliminary results  with predictive neural responses  suggest that we can achieve semantic auditory  decoding using \nlarge -scale language models.

    "Towards Semantic Encoding of Visual Content in Movies via \nHigh-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography  \n \nWiete Fehner1*, Morgan Fogarty1, Aahana Bajracharya1, Zachary E. Markow1, Dana \nWilhelm1, Jason Trobaugh1, Alexander G. Huth2, Joseph P Culver1 \n \n1Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130, USA, 2The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, 78712, TX, USA  \n ∗Presenting Author's  email address: f.wiete@wustl.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Visual s emantic maps are related to language processing and cover  extensive cortical \nareas. This study aims to develop  very high -density  Diffuse Optical Tomography  (VHD -DOT) for \nvisual semantic mapping  in a naturalistic setting . Here , we demonstrate that VHD-DOT has \nsufficient signal power (high explained variance) for applying  a visual semantic voxelwise encoding  \nmodel.  \n \nIntroduction:  Visual s emantic mapping represents a  rich set of object category features  that are connected to \nlanguage processing and  map vast cortical regions, as shown in recent fMRI studies [1]. This method uses \nnaturalistic stimuli and can  be applied to explore  language -related questions such as brain development and \nlanguage disorders. Semantic mapping may help create augmented  communication tools for clinical groups, such as \nstroke -induced aphasia patients. Visual s emantic  maps can be generated using regularized linear regression to \ncharacterize the response of voxels to visual object category features. These  encoding models for  visual  semantic \nmapping require several hours of training data, making fMRI a n expensive imaging modality. On the other hand, \nunlike fMRI, high -density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT) provides a portable and cost -effective alternative \nfor brain mapping in natural settings. We aim  to build a semantic encoding model with very high-density DOT  \n(VHD -DOT) using a diverse training set  of naturalistic movies . The objects in the movie were categorized based on \ntheir semantic relationships using WordNet labels . To apply an encoding model, it is necessary to have high \nrepeatability across multiple imaging sessions required for data collection. This study aims  to demonstrate the \nrepeatability across sessions and high signal power for test movies . Methods: One participant completed three 89 -\nminute VHD-DOT imaging sessions. To ensure session repeatability, cap placement followed a recently developed \nprecision protocol [ 2]. Each session included four 10 -minute training and three 10 -minute testing movie runs. This \ngives  120 min of unique training data and 90 minutes of testing data. The testing data consists  of 9 unique minutes. \nMovie clips were validated in prior fMRI studies and  manually  labeled using semantic WordNet categories by [1]. \nData  is processed utilizing  a standard DOT pipeline, including  pre-processing, reconstruction, and spectroscopy. \nActivation  maps for individual runs were created using a general linear model for auditory and visual localizer tasks.  \nCorrelation analysis was used to determine localizer repeatability across cap placements.  Moreover, explained \nvariance (EV) was used to assess the repeatability of  naturalistic  test movies , as it  represents the variance of the \nsignal related  to the stimulus . A higher EV suggests that the encoding model can predict a greater portion of the \nobserved signal in the test set, indicating a better model fit (Figure 1). Results: The experimental design \ndemonstrates  VHD-DOT's potential for semantic visual encoding in naturalistic settings. High repeatability across \nsessions, confirmed by localizer task correlation, and EV in test movies suggest that VHD-DOT can build complex \nvoxelwise encoding models for semantic categories.  Conclusion:  This study lays a foundation for semantic visual \nencoding of object categories from naturalistic movies using VHD-DOT.   \n \nReferences and Acknowledgments  \n1.  Huth, A.

    "SiPMs for Wearable Diffuse Optical Tomography \n \nWilliam T. Hamic, Edward J. Richter, Joseph P. Culver \n \nWashington University in St. Louis,  St. Louis  MO, USA \nwillhamic@wustl.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Silicon photomultipliers  (SiPMs)  bring the high performance of avalanche  photodiode s \n(APDs)  used in fiber-based diffuse optical tomography (DOT)  systems to a wearable form factor by \nachieving a high intrinsic gain with moderate bias voltage. A miniaturized SiPM module for a \nwearable high-density  DOT system is designed and evaluated, with a measured NEP of 3.6 and \n7.1fW /√Hz for 735 and 850nm wavelengths, more than an order of magnitude lower than PIN \nphotodiode modules . In a prototype wearable high-density DOT cap, this noise reduction is shown \nto allow  measurements at further source/detector distances than comparable  wearable systems.  \n \nIntroduction:  The APDs  used in fiber -DOT systems can require bias voltages in the hundreds of volts, making them \nunsuitable for use in a wearable system, often resulting in the use simpler PIN photodiodes. Without the intrinsic gain \nof the APD, the PIN photodiode  result s in a noise bottleneck in the amplifier that follows, limiting device performance. \nSiPMs provide high intrinsic gain with more moderate bias voltages, but face complications such as nonlinearity  and \ntemperature compensation . Methods: A fiber -based SiPM system was designed and evaluated to optimize device \nperformance, then a miniaturized SiPM module was designed to meet the same noise characteristics. Signal and noise \nlevels were measured on the bench, on an optical phantom , and in -vivo. A section of a wearable high -density SiPM \nDOT system was designed and evaluated.  Results: The miniaturized module, with two sources and  two detectors \neach, allows for a 13mm nearest -neighbor regular array. NEP was measured as 3.6 and 7.1fW/√Hz for 735 and 850nm \nwavelengths, lower than fiber -based APD systems and more than an order of magnitude lower than comparable PD \nsystems. Nonlinearity limits the dynamic range of the system but  can be compensated for by directly modulating \nsource brightness. Conclusion:  SiPMs are a promising candidate for increasing the maximum channel length and total \nchannel count in wearable high -density  DOT systems, and the additional design challenges they introduce can be \nmanaged for an overall increase in system performance.

    "High Density Diffuse Optical Tomography Reveals \nDifferential Associations of Functional Connectivity During \nMotor Observation and Imitation with Social Reciprocity  \n \nSung Min Park1, Tessa G. George1, Chloe M. Sobolewski1, Sophia R. McMorrow1, Dalin Yang1, Mary B. \nNebel3,4, Bahar Tunçgenç5, René Vidal2, Natasha Marrus1, Stewart H. Mostofsky3,4, , Adam T. Eggebrecht1 \n1Washington University in St. Louis; 2University of Pennsylvania 3Kennedy Krieger Institute; 4Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine;  \n5University of Nottingham  \ns.park@wustl.edu   \n \nAbstract:  We use high-density diffuse optical tomography to investigate brain activity during motor \nimitation and observation in neurotypical adults.  To address the potential variability caused by \nindividual differences in function al organization of the brain  and spatial variation resulting from \natlas-based head modeling, we use  independent component  analysis  with reference (ICA -R). \nSubject -specific spatiotemporal components of brain function derived using ICA -R exhibited \ndifferential functional connectivity (FC) patterns during motor observation and imitation. The FC \nbetween specific  components correlated with ratings of social reciprocity core to autism \npresentation .   \n \nIntroduction:  Motor imitation deficits have been shown to be particularly associated with autism spectrum disorder \n(ASD) and may contribute to the impaired development of social -communicative skills that are core to the ASD \nphenotype.  However, investigations on  brain activity during natural istic motor imitation  have been limited due to \nconstraints of common neuroimaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI ). Addressing \nthis, we  measure d cortical activity during  elicited  motor imitation in neurotypical adults  using high-density diffuse \noptical tomography  (HD-DOT) , which allows for more naturalistic imitation  (Fig. 1A) . Estimating functional \nconnectivity (FC) from HD -DOT data can be challenging due to the inherent variability in loca lization  of activation \nacross individuals resulting from data reconstruction process . To address this potential variability caused by spatial \nvariation , we applied  a data -driven analysis (Independent Component Analysis with Reference , ICA-R) to derive \nsubject -specific network components . \nMethods: HD-DOT  data and social responsiveness scale (SRS -2) self-ratings  assessing social reciprocity  (Fig. 1B) \nwere collected from 45 neurotypical adult  participants  (28 females ). In separate runs, participants either observed or \nimitated  movements of an on -screen avata r. We applied ICA-R using Gordon parcellation atlas (Gordon, 2016) to \nidentify subject -specific spatiotemporal components  of brain activity  and assessed FC patterns during motor \nobservation and imitation  (Fig. 1C) using  the GIFT toolbox  (https://trendscenter.org/trends/software/gift/ ). FC \ndifferences  between observation and imitation were assessed using paired t -tests with false discovery rate (FDR) \ncorrection  (Fig. 1D). Pearson correlation analyzed the linear relationship between behavioral scores and FC pairs . \nResults: Estimated ICA -R components show high spatial similarity with reference networks, while exhibiting \nvariance across subjects.  During observation , FC within the Default mode network was correlated  with SRS -2 score . \nDuring imitation, FC between cingulo -opercular and somatomotor  regions were correlated the SRS -2 (Fig. 1E-F). \nConclusion:  ICA-R estimates individualized spatiotemporal representation of brain activation during motor \nobservation and imitation. The FC derived from ICA -R show differential activation during observation and imitation \nand are  correlated with the SRS-2. While this analysis focused on adults without ASD, our future work aims to extend \nthis analysis in adult s and  in school -age children (7 -16 years) , including those with ASD . \n279 of 398",

Paediatrics,  University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada . \nltang232@uwo.ca  \n \nAbstract:  Early brain injur y in neonates increase  the risk of later neurodevelopmental disorders , yet \nit is unclear how the injuries affect early  brain  development . Therefore , we examined  the association \nbetween d ynamic functional connectivity (dFC), which reflects the functional flexibility of the \nbrain,  and the postmenstrual age of neonates with or without brain injur y. We scanned healthy \nnewborns  with fNIRS, plus those  with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and intraventricular \nhemorrhage.  We found that healthy infants yielded positive correlation s between dFC and \npostmenstrual age  while the brain injury groups  showed negative associations  of these variables , \nwhich could indicate disrupted or delayed trajector ies of development.  \n \nIntroduction:  Early brain injur y can result  in preterm or term born infants  due to ischemia, or immature blood vessel s. \nWith survival rate s much improved over the last two decades, in fants may still suffer from  neurodevelopmental \nsequelae  (e.g., cerebral palsy, motor delay, cognitive delay, vision and hearing impairments ). Functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) offers the ability to assess the functional connectivity  of neonatal brains ; yet it is still unclear \nhow early injuries can affect brain development  in the first days of life , especially in terms of dynamic functional \nconnectivity (dFC). dFC captures the constant reconfiguration of brain networks  and adaptive adjustments in response \nto internal a nd external stimuli. The temporal variability of dFC characterizes functional  flexibility of the brain , which \ncan also be impacted  by brain injur y.  \nMethods:  Three  groups of neonates w ere recruited :  neonates  born preterm  with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), \nterm born neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy , and term-born healthy newborns . All three groups were \nscanned with fNIRS  for 6 minutes  at term equivalent age  under task -free conditions . fNIRS system was set up with 8 \nsources and 8 detectors, yielding 20 channels covering the whole brain. dFC was calculated by moving  a sliding \nwindow of 30 -second width through the signals with  steps of 1 second. For each time step  of each subject , a \nconnectivity map was derived  using  Pearson correlation s. Then the  map w as vectorized and  correlated with a static \nconnectivity map  (from the whole time sequence)  of the participant  to obtain one single value at a time point. This \nwas done for both oxygenated  (HbO)  and deoxygenated (Hb) hemoglobin, respectively. To measure the temporal \nvariability, 3 me trics were applied, namely standard deviation  (SD) , amplitude of low frequency fluctuation  (ALFF)  \nand Lempel -Ziv complexity  (LZC). The measurements were then associated with postmenstrual age  (PMA)  using  \nlinear models  with p -value and correlation (r) measured . \nResults: For HbO, as shown in Fig. 1, we found that PMA  was positively correlated with ALFF  (p=0.038, r=0.37) \nand SD  (p=0.005 , r=0.49 ) in the health y newborns , yet the correlation s were insignificant and negative  in the  HIE and \nIVH groups . We found no significant correlation of LZC and PMA within any groups. Hb results are mostly similar \nto HbO.  \nConclusion:  Our study reveal ed distinct \ndevelopmental patterns in healthy neonates \ncompared to those with brain injuries, as evidenced \nby the temporal variance of dFC in HbO and Hb. \nSpecifically, we observed positive correlations \nbetween PMA and ALFF/SD in healthy controls \nbut insignif icant or negative correlations in the HIE \nand IVH groups, suggesting potential disruptions or \ndelays in development due to these injuries. Findings underscore the utility of fNIRS in monitoring and characterizing \nneonatal brain development, offering valuab le insights for early intervention strategies in infants at risk of neurological \nimpairment . \n280 of 398",
    "Fiber-less speckle contrast optical spectroscopy system using \na multi-hole aperture method \n \nJimin Lee1, Seongkwon Yu1, Bumjun Koh1, Yuqing Liang1, Hyeon-Min Bae1* \n \n1School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute  of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea  \n*hmbae @kaist.ac.kr  \n \nAbstract:  A multi -hole aperture fiber-less SCOS  system  is proposed.  In conventional SCOS \nsystems, there exists an upper limit on the aperture size, since the minimum speckle size must be \ngreater than the Nyquist pixel rate. Consequently, obtaining high light intensity under long source -\ndetector distance is a challenge. In the solid phantom experiment, the proposed  multi -hole aperture \nSCOS system exhibits higher intensity and contrast compared to conventional  single -hole aperture \nSCOS system.  In both two -layer liquid phantom and in-vivo arm-cuff extension experiments, the \nproposed system exhibit s higher sensitivity  with respect to the blood flow . \n \nIntroduction:  Speckle contrast optical spectroscopy  (SCOS) measures  blood flow in deep tissue  by using  the contrast \nvalue of speckle patterns . Conventional SCOS system suffers from low SNR  when measuring speckle s over long \nsource -detector distances . This is because  the maximum laser irradiance  applied to the skin is limited according to the \nsafety standard s, and the maximum size of camera aperture is also restricted  under  the Nyquist rate condition  – the \nsize of speckle , determined by the diffraction pattern formula , is inversely proportional to the aperture size  and the \npixel size should be less than the speckle size  at least by a factor of two . As a result, various methods have been \nattempted to overcome  low SNR  at long source -detector  (SD)  distances.   \nMethods: We aim to address this issue by modifying the aperture structure of the camera.  We created an optode  array  \nwith 2 detectors and 1 source,  and the  SD distances are both  20mm  (Figure 1) . One channel is dedicated for the \nproposed multi -hole aperture  system  which has  a total of nine holes:  each with a diameter of 1mm, on a 3 x3 grid with \n2 mm spacing . The other channel is for  a single -hole aperture with a diameter of 1m m, modeling existing SCOS \nsystem . All apertures were produced using a laser -jet printer on an OHP film. We utilized a collimating lens  (Thorlabs, \n355230 -B) with an 850  nm TO can laser diode  (Optowell, HV85 -0003M1 ) to create a pencil beam, and an NIR-\nsensitive  CMOS image sensor  (Omnivision, OG01A1B ) was used. High -speed recording at 240  fps was conducted \nunder the conditions of 16x analog gain with 3.2 ms exposure.  \nResults: In the solid phantom  experiment (Figur e 2, 3 ), multi -hole aperture channel  demonstrate  higher luminance \nand contrast values in proportional to the photon flux compared to single -hole aperture channel.  This result indicates \nthat the proposed multi -hole aperture  can deliver  a stronger s ignal. In the two-layer  liquid phantom experiment  (Figure \n4), the contrast value of multi -hole aperture channel decays, while the contrast value of the other channel remain ing \nabove 1 . This means the multi -hole aperture  channel  has higher sensitivity  with respect to  blood flow . In the in -vivo \narm-cuff extension experiment  (Figure 5) , multi -hole aperture  channel  demonstrates  timely recovery to the baseline, \nindicating sensitive response in contrast to the conventional single -hole aperture system.  \nConclusion:  The proposed multi -hole aperture structure  achieve s higher  contrast  by increasing  photon flux, compared \nto existing  SCOS systems . Since the proposed method increases SNR without using any optical fibers, it can be \nevolved into a low -cost and fully wearable SCOS system . \n Figure 1(top-left): 2-Channel \nSCOS system.    \nFigure 2, 3(top-center, right) : \nMeasuring the intensity / contrast \nfor both channels while increasing \nthe power  of the laser.   \nFigure 4(bottom -right): \nMeasuring the contrast  for both \nchannels while increasing the \nstirring speed of liquid .  \nFigure 5(bottom -left): Measuring \nthe contrast for arm-cuff extension. \nMoving Average = 0.1s   \n281 of 398",
    "Soundscapes of the Brain:  Enabling Visual -Free \nInterpretation of fNIRS Data through Sonification  \n \nEdgar Guevara,a,b*  \n \na CONAHCYT -Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, Mexico   \nb Coordinación para la Innovación y Aplicación de la Ciencia y la Tecnología, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, Mexico  \n*edgar.guevara@uaslp.mx   \n \nAbstract:  The rapid advancement of functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has \nsignificantly increased the volume and complexity of neuroimaging data.  Traditional data \ninterpretation methods  may not fully leverage the potential for intuitive understanding and \naccessibility  for visually impaired researchers . Here, I introduce a novel approach to enhance the \ninterpretation of fNIRS data through sonification. This method transforms fNIRS data into spatially \nweighted audible soundscapes, allowing listener s to perceive and interpret complex patterns and \ndynamics audibly. This approach aids in making the data more accessible and fosters a more \nintuitive grasp of underlying biological phenomena.  \n \nIntroduction:  The idea of representing data from EEG1 and fMRI2 in humans and data from wide -field optical \nimaging and SCAPE microscopy in mice3 has been demonstrated previously , but not specifically for fNIRS data ; \nhence, this work aims  to develop a pipeline to occupy that specific niche.  \nMethods: I employed  fNIRS (22 long + 2 short channels , Artinis Brite MKII ) to cover the prefrontal cortex of a \nparticipant who performed 7 s mental arithmetic followed by 20 -24 s rest. Optode coordinates were digitized  \n(Polhemus ). This trial was repeated ten times to estimate the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) via GLM after \ndiscarding channels with low SNR and correcting motion artifacts with spline + wavelet processing. Only HbO was \nconsidered for further processing. The HRF signals were then transformed into a sinusoidal signal by modulating both \nthe frequency and amplitude based on the HRF's amplitude, which  we call sonification. This unique method allowed \nus to resample the signals for auditory playback between two oc taves spannin g 130.813 Hz (C3) and 523.251 Hz  (C5). \nThen, the amplitude of every channel was adjusted between 10% and 100% of its original amplitude based on its MNI \ncoordinates. HRFs from each brain hemisphere were mixed into their corresponding stereo output channel . This \nprocess is called spatially weighted  signal normalization.  Five non-visually impaired volunteers listened to the \nresulting audio signals.  \nResults: The sonification of a single channel HRF (Fig1a) can be liste ned to at https://youtu.be/N7Qx7dwL34Y , \nwhile the  result of the spatially weighted signal normalization of all the ch annels of the fNIRS probe  (Fig1b) can be \nlistened to at https://youtu.be/fbfwueeWC -4. The use of headphones is strongly  encouraged to appreciate the subtle \nspatial variations . Listeners subjectively appreciated changes in pitch \nand intensity, which correlated directly with the amplitude variations \nof the hemodynamic response function (HRF), enhancing their \nunderstanding of underlying neural activities . Alas, all participants \nconsidered the output boring a nd monotonous.  \nConclusion:  The sonification method may identify the time course of \nhemodynamic activity , which provide s visually impaired people with \na real -time strategy for monitoring fNIRS signals . Future work is \nneeded to include HbR signals  in the sonification process  and consider \nother types of signal mapping, e.g.,  music al instrument digital interface \n(MIDI ) and the inclusion of rules to modulate the timbre and duration \nof individual notes.  A musician with ample experience is being \nrecruited to improve the subjective quality of the sonification output.  \nAcknowledgments : CONAHCYT  Frontier Science project 20884  & \nIxM program project 528.  \n \nReferences  \n1 Wu, D. et al.

This presentation investigates the \npotential utility of the Openwater Cerebral Blood Flow Monitor.  \n \nMethods and Results : We will discuss the results of two recently published experiments [1,  2]. In the first work \n[1], we monitored 25 healthy adults with the Openwater system and concurrent transcranial Doppler (TCD) while \nperforming a breath -hold maneuver to increase CBF.  A strong correlation was observed between beat -to-beat \noptical rBF and TCD -measured cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), R = 0.79; the slope of the linear fit indicates \ngood agreement, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83 í 0.92). In the second work [2], w e emplo yed the Openwater instrument to \ndetect large vessel occlusion (LVO) in patients undergoing acute stroke evaluation. Amongst 135 patients, the \nmedian NIHSS was 8 (IQR:4 -14), and 52 (39%) had an anterior circulation LVO based on CT angiogram. The \nOpenwater instrument  had 79% sensitivity and 84% specificity for the detection of LVO, outperforming pre -hospital \nstroke scales for the detection of LVO in patients who presented to the Emergency Department for acute stroke \nevaluation. These encouraging findings need to be va lidated in the pre -hospital environment. Further work is needed \nto corroborate these encouraging initial findings.  \n \nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by National Institutes of He alth (K23 -NS110993, CGF) , (P41-\nEB015893, AGY ), and  an investigator -initiated grant from Open water .

    "Investigating Awareness in Alzheimer ’s Disease with fNIRS  \n \nGarima Gupta1, Matthew Kolisnyk1, Karnig Kazazian1, Rafeh Shahid1, Diana Urian1, Sergio Novi Jr., PhD1, \nKoula Pantazopoulos2, Androu Abdalmalak, PhD1, Jonathan D Huntley, PhD3, Derek Debicki, MD, PhD1, \nStephen H Pasternak, MD, PhD1,2 and Adrian Owen, PhD1  \n \n(1) Western University, London, ON, Canada, (2) Parkwood Institute  at St Joseph's Healthcare Center, London, ON, Canada, (3) University \nCollege London, London, United Kingdom   \nPresenting Author email address: mkolisny@uwo.ca  \n \nAbstract:  Our study  used fNIRS to explore awareness in  patients with  Alzheimer’s disease (AD ). \nWe measured neural synchronization in 11 mild-to-moderate AD patients and 29 age -matched \ncontrols who were presented with both regular and scrambled movie narratives . As expected , \ncontrols showed significant synchronization in fronta l and parietal regions in response to the regular \nclips and only selective temporal regions in response to the scrambled clips. In contrast, AD patients \ngenerally showed little to no neural synchronization with control s. These results suggest that AD \npatient s may be experiencing the narratives differently from controls, likely owing to the cognitive \nimpairments associated with AD . \n \nIntroduction: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of dementia that progressively impairs memory, language, and \ndaily functioning. As the disease progresses, these impairments worsen to a point where it is unclear how AD \npatients are experiencing themselves and their environment. This uncertainty leads to increased caregiver strain, \npoor clinical outcomes, and complicates care -based d ecision -making. Our study use d a validated neuroimaging \nparadigm that measures changes in brain activity in response to movie narratives. We investigate d whether changes \nin the brain activity of patients synchronize with those of controls, particularly in front al and parietal regions \nassociated with higher -order processing. Quantifying the amount of synchronization estimates the extent of shared \nprocessing of the narratives between patients and controls, enabling some inference of an individual patient’s \nexperie nce of the clips.  \n \nMethods: Participants  in this study  included patients with mild -to-moderate AD ( n = 11) and age -matched healthy \ncontrols ( n = 29). Participants were presented with four narrative stimuli, including an audiovisual clip from the \nmovie Bang\u0004 You’re Dead\u0004  and an audio -only clip from the movie Taken , in addition to scrambled versions of each \nof those clips. The scrambled clips were used as control  stimuli , which  maintained  the lower -level sensory \ninformation of the clips but lacked a coherent narrative. FNIRS d ata were acquired with a continuous -wave system \n(NIRScoutXP, NIRx Medical Systems) with 32 sources and 39 detectors, allowing measurement from 121 regular \nand eight short channels. The probe coverage included frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. The data  were corrected \nfor motion artifacts, band -pass filtered, and influences from short channels were regressed. HbO and HbR responses \nto all clips were used to compute inter -subject synchronization (ISC), which measures the correlation in the neural \ntime seri es between an individual participant and the rest of the group. The statistical significance of the ISCs was \nassessed for each movie narrative and group using permutation testing incorporating FDR correction via the max t \nmethod.  \n \nResults: As expected , controls showed significant ISCs in frontal and parietal regions in both Bang\u0004 You’re Dead\u0004  \nand Taken , and only significant ISCs in the temporal lobe in the scrambled clips. In contrast, as a group, AD patients \nshowed markedly reduced or no ISCs acros s the entire brain in response to both regular and scrambled clips. \nHowever, this finding may be patient -specific, as two AD patients demonstrated ISCs in response to the regular clips \nwithin the range of controls.  \n \nConclusion: These preliminary findings s uggest that AD patients may be experiencing the world differently from \nhealthy individuals. The variability noted in synchronization across AD patients may reflect heterogeneity in \ndisease -related impairments. Understanding deficits and patient needs from the lens of impaired conscious \nprocessing could support disease prognosis and promote improvements in person -centered care.  \n \n 284 of 398",

In our novel \nwork employing these tools, we  observe preliminary  function al response at the onset of Phase 2 . \n \nIntroduction:  Literature reveals robust connections between infant emotion regulation (ER) in infancy and \npsychopathology developed in childhood or adolescence1, as well as  the effectiveness of therap ies targeting ER  to \ndecrease  psychopathology2. While effort s have been made  to characterize ER behaviorally , and neurobiologically  in \nnon-infant  populations, th e infant ER neural mechanisms are not adequately defined. “Still Face Paradigm” (SFP ) is \nideal for observing  infants’  ER during  a real -time, structur ed interaction3. Only  one publi cation demonstrates infant \nfunctional activ ity, detected  via fNIRS , during  an SFP with sub -segmented phases4. This demonstrates initial  \nfeasibility , yet there is still great untapped  potential in measuring  infant brain activity elicited during SFP. Our work \nprovides the first dataset of its kind, combining fNIRS use with full S FP. When  extended  to include  different types of \ninfant ER  behavior5, this work has potential to  capture neural underpinnings of  natural istic behavioral ER responses . \nMethods: Data is collected from ten six-month old  infants \nand will continue up to  as many as 100 s ubjects . Infants wear \na NIRSport2 system  during a  nine-minute modified SFP6. \nVideo footage is collected , from which we will code  behavior  \nusing  the modified Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phases  \nsystem5. fNIRS data undergoes standard processing. Channel \nresults are averaged into cluster for each subject, then clusters \naveraged across subjects for group results. Statistical t -test \nwill compar e each cluster ’s functional response  of the high \nER group to that of the dysregulated  group.  \nResults: Preliminary analysis show s hemodynamic response  \nduring Phase 2 onset in the  left TPJ (de -activation) and left \ndlPFC (activation)  regional cluster s. We observe anticipated \nactivation in the left dlPFC during both Phases 2 and 34. \nConclusion:  Our preliminary findings suggest involvement \nof left TPJ and left  dlPFC in infant ER  during SFP Phase 2 . \nThis is the first known measurement of SFP-induced functional activation in infants , and, when coupled with \nreferenced works4,5, demonstrates the feasibility of complet ing the remaining study analysis  for this  novel work \nelucidating the functional mechanisms of real -time ER in infants . \nAcknowledgements: Supported by NIH/NCATS KL2TR001455, Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center, and UMass Center \nfor Clinical and Translational Science . \nReferences:  \n1.

    "Caregiver’s Respiration Affects fNIRS Signals in Cuddled \nNewborns   \n \nL. Pollonini1*, B. Blanco2*, the PIPKIN study team2, M. H. Johnson2 and S. Lloyd-Fox2 \n \n*Equal Contribution, 1University of Houston, TX, USA, 2University of Cambridge , Cambridge, UK   \nPresenting Author email address: lpollonini@uh.edu , bb579@cam.ac.uk   \nAbstract:  W e  f o u n d  e v i d e n c e  a  o f  d i srupting effect of caregiver’s respiration in HD-DOT \nexperiments where newborn infants were comfortably cuddled close to the shoulder and chest during \ndata acquisition. This component masked other sign al components (e.g., cardiac) and may overlap \nin frequency with task-related hemodynamic processes of interest in the infant. Investigators must \nbe aware of this issue to reduce cuddling against chest during data acquisition whenever possible, \nor to attenuate its impact during data preprocessing.    \nIntroduction:  N e u r o i m a g i n g  u s i n g  w e a r a b l e  h i g h - d e n s i t y  d i f f u s e  o p t i c a l  t o m o g r a p h y  ( H D - D O T )  o f f e r s  a n  \nunprecedented insight of neurodevelopment al processes during the first days of life. Conducting neuroimaging studies \non infants at such an early age often requires cuddling to ensure comfort, safety, and correct cap placement throughout \nthe experiment. This sometimes entails holding the infants’ h ead against the caregiver’s shoulder or chest, in positions \nthat are now facilitated by the wearable HD-DOT headg ear design. However, while analyzing HD-DOT datasets \ncollected on newborns in this position, we consistently detected unexpected oscillations in the fNIRS signals at \nfrequencies distant from well-known systemic components lik e cardiac pulsation and respiration. In this work we \nsought to methodically identify the source of such previously unseen components. \nMethods: Three infants between 13 and 38 days of age were scanned with a 12-tile HD-DOT system (LUMO, \nGowerlabs, UK) bilaterally on frontal and temporal cortical  regions. Raw signals were bandpass filtered between 0.01 \nand 3.5 Hz to include all physiological signals (cerebral and extra-cerebral), while removing higher frequency noise \nand harmonics. From each scan, we se lected a 20-second time interval fr ee of abrupt movement artifacts and \nperformed a principal component analysis (PCA). For each op tical channel, we determined the dominant component \nby linear correlation with the bandpass filtered fNIRS signal s at different ranges of inter-optode distance. We also \nanalyzed video-recordings of the experimental session to infer the posture of newborn and caregiver and to assess the \npresence of respiration movements. The analysis is currently ongoing on a dataset of more than 100 subjects. \nResults: In all scans, the PCA analysis consistently revealed the presence of a periodic oscillation with a frequency \nof 0.2-0.4 Hz (PC2), alongside the expected cardiac (PC1), respiratory (PC4) and slow-drift components (PC3) (Fig. \n1, short-separation channels only). Critically, the extraneous PC was clustered in a specific region of adjacent channels \n(Fig. 2) which happened to be in direct contact with the caregiver’s chest, while the cardiac component was found to \nbe dominant in all other spatial locations. Interestingly, the caregiver’s respiratory com ponent was found in phase and \nantiphase in different optical channels both within the same tile and across different tiles. \nConclusion:  Researchers investigating neurodevelopment with fN IRS should be cognizant of the potential effect of \ncaregiver’s respiration during data acquisition while cuddli ng against chest. Such awareness will aid in identifying \nand attenuating the impact of this confounding component or exploring alternative cuddling positions such as on \ncaregiver's lap, whenever feasible. We speculate that such component is a movement artifact that modulates the optical \nsignal at frequencies that may overlap with hemodynamic processes of interest, and the phase-antiphase channels \nwithin a tile may indicate an uneven landing of the light pipes on the infants’ scalp.  \n \nFigure 1:  Stacked plot of principal components. \n \nFigure 2:  Location of dominant principal component \nin short-separation channels.

    "Using fNIRS to Examine Neural Mechanisms of Change \nAssociated with  Mindfulness -Based Interventions  \n \nYimin Jin1, Qingyang Liu2, Rachel A Razza2   \n1Department of Psychology  \n2Department of Human Development and Family Science  \nSyracuse University   \nYjin08@syr.edu/  qliu08@syr.edu /rrazza@syr.edu   \nAbstract:  This study explores the neural mechanisms of change in individuals participating in \nmindfulness -based interventions (MBI) using functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Data \nwere  collected from 17 participants performing  tasks designed  to measure  neuro -cognitive \nfunctions , including  attentional control, emotional regulation, and working memory . These tasks \nincluded  Emotional Stroop, Emotional Working Memory, Go/No Go, N -back, and Reaction Time. \nEight participants completed  an 8-week MBI program, while nine  participants  were in the control \ngroup . Preliminary analys es are ongoing, with comp lete results expected  by summer. This research \naims to elucidate  the effects  of MBIs on  cognitive functions through direct  neurophysiological \nmeasures . \nIntroduction:  Mindfulness -based interventions (MBI s) are increasingly recognized for their potential to improve  \ncognitive and emotional well -being (Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh, 2015) . However, the underlying neural \nmechanisms  of MBI benefits  remain underexplored . This study aims to address  this literature  gap by utilizing \nfunctional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine  the neural correlates  associated with  MBIs. Specifically, \nwe explore how MBIs influence neuro -cognitive functions , including  attentional control, emotional regulation, and \nworking memory. By directly measuring  brain activity, this research aims  to quantify the neurophysiological changes \nelicited by mindfulness practices, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how these interventions may bolster  \ncognitive functions. Integrating  fNIRS data with behavioral assessments from mindfulness tasks and surveys on \nperceived stress and mindfulness attitudes, this study provides  a comprehensive analysis of the effects  of MBIs on \nboth brain function and behavior.  \nMethods:  fNIRS data were collected from 17 college students participants as they engaged in  five mindfulness  \nbenchmark  tasks:  Emotional Stroop , Emotional Working Memory, Go/No Go, N-back, and R eaction Time in both \npre-test and post -test. Participants were divided into two groups: intervention and control group:  eight  participants  \nattended  an 8-week MBI s program , while nine  participant s did not. Task assignment was randomized across \nparticipants The templates are assigned based on the participants their ID number s to ensure variability in task \npresentations . Participant also completed  survey s to assess  their perceived stress  levels  using  the Perceived Stress \nScale (Lee, 2012 ) and their mindfulness -related attitudes and behaviors  using  the Five Facet Mindfulness \nQuestionnaire (Christopher, Neuser, Michael, & Baitmangalkar, 2012) . \nResults: Preliminary analysis of the fNIRS  data is currently in progress . A mixed -design ANOVA will be employed \nto assess both within -subject effects (changes over time within participants) and between -subject effects (differences \nbetween the control and intervention groups) . This analysis plan will enable us to effectively delineate  changes in \nbrain activity patterns associated with  attentional control, emotional regulation, and working memory. Although \nspecific data are yet to be finalized, initial findings are expected to shed light on the neuro physiological impacts of \nmindfulness -based interventions.  \nConclusion:  The complete  analysis, expected  by this summer, will provide comprehensive insights into the influence \nof mindfulness training on cognitive functions. This study aims to provide  evidence of the neurophysiological benefits \nof mindfulness practices, which could inform their broader application  in non -clinical populations.  \nEthics Statement : All study procedures were approved by Syracuse  University’s Institutional Review Board for \nHuman Subjects Research  at Syracuse University, Syracuse, N ew York , United States .

    "The Impact of Extensive Reading on Listening \nComprehension: A Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy \n(fNIRS) Study of Frontal Lobe Activation  \nKatsuhiro Chiba1, Takushige Katsura2, Atsuko Miyazaki3 \n \n1. Bunkyo University, 5-6-1 Hanahata, Adach-ku, Tokyo121-8577, Japan \n2. Tokyo City University, 1-28-1 Tamazutsumi,Setagaya-ku,Tokyo158-8557, Japan  \n3. The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo153-8904, Japan   \n \nAbstract:  This study investigates the effects of Extensive Reading (ER) on listening comprehension \nin second language  (L2) acquisition, focusing on frontal lobe  activation. Twenty -four Japanese \nuniversity students participated in the study, with 1 4 students in the ER group and 10 in the non -ER \ngroup. Participants completed a listening task with varying speeds, answering 60 True or False \nquestions. The ER group showed significantly higher English proficiency, accuracy rates, and faster \nreaction times  compared to the non -ER group. Frontal lobe activation during the listening task was \nmeasured using fNIRS to explore the underlying mechanisms of ER's impact on listening \ncomprehension and significant  activation at Broadman n area 46 was observed.  \n \nIntroduction:  Extensive reading (ER) is a widely recognized method in L2 acquisition, with initial benefits often \nobserved in listening skills. However, the underlying mechanisms behind this improvement remain unclear. This study \naims to investigate the effects of ER on listening comprehension by measuring frontal lobe activat ion using functional \nnear-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a listening task with varying speeds.  \nMethods: Twenty -four right -handed Japanese university students (11 males, 13 females; mean age 20.54, SD 1.215) \nparticipated in the study. The ER group consisted of 14 students (mean ER word count: 920,537), while the non -ER \ngroup had 10 students (mean ER word coun t: 4,246).  Listening Task : Participants completed a listening task with 20 \naudio passages at varying speeds (150, 175, 200, and 225 wpm), with five passages at each speed. Each passage was \nfollowed by three True or False questions, resulting in a total of 60  questions. The order of the passages was \nrandomized. Behavioral data, including accuracy rates and reaction times, were collected.  English Proficiency Test : \nParticipants completed the CASEC test, a standardized English proficiency test, to assess their overall English \nlanguage ability.  fNIRS Measurement of Frontal Lobe Activation : Frontal lobe activation during listening was \nmeasured using a wearable fNIRS topography system (WOT -HS) with 3 4 channels covering the lateral and anterior \nfrontal lobe. Measuring frontal lobe activity is crucial, as the DLPFC is involved in L2 comprehension and language \nrelated  to working memory.  \nResults: Due to the limited number of participants, behavioral data were compared using the Sum of Accuracy and \nResponse Time Scores (SARTS), which combines reaction times and accuracy rates. The results showed significant \ndifferences in favor of the ER group at 150 ( t(22)=1.677, p=.054), 175 ( t(22)=1.758, p=.046), and 200 wpm \n(t(22)=1.795, p=.043) (Table1) . Based on these findings, an exploratory comparison of brain activity during the 200 \nwpm listening task , the most challenging speed, was conducted. The ER group exhibited significantly higher brain \nactivation in BA46 , which corresponds to the DLPFC  (Figure 1 ). Although this finding contradicts the hypothesis that \nhigher proficiency leads to processing with less cerebral blood flow, it suggests that when faced with higher difficulty, \neffective utilization of this region enables faster and more accurate informat ion processing.   \nConclusion:  This study confirmed that ER affects L2 listening processing, as shown by behavioral data,  and also \nsuggested differences in brain activity in the frontal lobe. Future tasks should include more subjects from the non -ER \ngroup and compare the cumulative average  brain activity in the frontal lobe of each group by the speed of the tasks.   \n \n Figure 1 Frontal Lobe Activation and the wearable fNIRS topography system used  in the study   \n289 of 398",
    "Real-time Brain -Computer Interface based on fNIRS  \n \nEunji Won1, Seongyeon Lim1, Suh-Yeon Dong2 \n \n1Dept. of Information Technology Engineering, Sookmyung Women’s University, Seoul, 04310, Republic of Korea  \n2Div. of Artificial Intelligence Engineering, Sookmyung Women’s University, Seoul, 04310, Republic of Korea  \nPresenting Author email address:  sydong@sookmyung.ac.kr  \n \nAbstract:  This study proposes a real -time Brain -Computer Interface (BCI) system based on \nfunctional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). W e implemented a Rapid Serial Visual \nPresentation (RSVP) paradigm with stimuli presentation times under one second. Using Lab \nStreaming Layer, we can record markers of stimuli presentation and participant responses directly \nonto the fNIRS signal in real-time. We demonstrated the system's ability to distinguish between rare \ntarget and non -target s. This preliminary research substantiates the potential for applying  fNIRS -\nbased BCI systems into environments requiring rapid stimulus presentation.  \n \nIntroduction: Recent advances in brain -computer interfaces (BCIs) have sparked significant interest in developing \nsystems that can interact directly with neural activity in real -time [1]. Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) \nhas emerged as a promising mo dality for BCI. Despite its potential, it has been limited its usage in BCIs  due to the \nlow temporal resolution of fNIRS caused by the time delay of the hemodynamic response  [2]. This study introduces \na novel real -time fNIRS -based BCI system designed to op erate a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm \nwhere stimuli are presented at sub -second intervals. Our primary objective is to demonstrate the system's ability to \naccurately differentiate between infrequent target and non -target stimuli rapidly,  a crucial capability for applications \nrequiring quick response times and high levels of accuracy. This preliminary study of rapid processing in fNIRS -based \nBCI systems could significantly broaden their applicability in various real -world scenarios.  \nMethods: We adapted the discrimination/selection response (DSR) task from Shin et al. [3], modifying it for a RSVP \nparadigm . We partitioned the DSR task into separate target and non -target sequences , with an extended inter-stimulus \nstimulus  to facilitate t he distinct detection of responses to each.  fNIRS data were collected using the NIRSport2 system  \n(NIRx Medizintechnik GmbH, Germany ), allowing for enhanced detection and discrimination of neural correlates \nassociated with the task.  Moreover, the recording software (Aurora fNIRS, NIRx Medizintechnik GmbH, Germany ) \nis synchronized with the task presentation software (PsychoPy, v2023.1.3) via Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) , to record \nand analyze the markers of stimuli and responses directly from the fNIRS signals  (see Figure 1) .  \nResults: In this preliminary study, four female healthy individuals participated (ages: 25.75 ±2.05 years ). At the end \nof each sequence, participants were asked to respond the presence of a target. The implemented system successfully \ncaptured markers for sequence  initiation and conclusion, along with the participants’ responses, directly into the fNIRS \ndataset in the Aurora software.  By comparing the concentration changes of the oxygenated hemoglobin  between target \nand non -target sequences, we could observe a noticeable difference in the hemodynamic responses  in real -time.  \nConclusion:  Our proposed  system demonstrated the capability for real -time tracking of hemodynamic responses, \nwell-aligned with the task presentation. Early analysis indicates the system's improved precision in differentiating \nneural activity associated with target versus  non-target \nstimuli. This proficiency signals promising enhancements \nin fNIRS -based BCI technology for more responsive and \nwider  applications.  \nReferences : \n1. Netzer, E., Frid, A., and Feldman, D.

Simulation results reveal that the proposed AI -approach excels conventional  numerical \nalgorithm  in terms of accuracy . Additionally , the measured oxygen saturation demonstrates  \nsignificant ly high correlation between jugular  venous oxygen saturation  compared to commercial  \nsystem.  \n \nIntroduction:  Stroke is a leading  cause of death and disability worldwide. Due to rapid loss of brain cells during  the \nstroke, emergent diagnosis and treatment are critica l for desired prognosis.  Near -infrared spectroscopy  (NIRS)  with \nits ambulatory  and portable nature can be an appropriate technology for timely monitoring of the stroke. However, the \nhuman body is composed of highly scattering  medium  together with  extra-cerebral layer  contamination , making \naccurate diagnosis difficult.  In this study , a high -density NIRS system utilizing neural network  (NIRSIT -X) is \nproposed  to measure accurate regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO 2). The proposed system is  evaluated through  porcine \ncommon carotid artery occlusion (CCAO)  experiment s. \nMethods: NIRSIT -X consists of  two flexible patches , each patch with  two four-wavelengths laser sources and sixty  \nphoto detectors, that provid e multi -distance measurements  (Fig. 1) . The convolution neural network , trained with  \nphoton simulation -generated data , extract s blood oxygen saturation  of the cerebral cortex layer  from the captured  \noptical density  images.  The training dataset consist of 600 MR image s, including  a porcine  forehead with the layers \nof scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, and white matter . Each layer is assigned with  optical propert ies with boundary \nconditions.  To verify the model , simulation is conducted  using data generated from 150 images that are different from \nthe training  dataset. A total of nine porcine  (25~30kg)  were subjected  to bilateral CCAO  with 30 min of ischemia, \nfollowed by 10 min of reperfusion . The NIRSIT -X and commercial system  (INVOSTM 5100)  were attach ed to each \nleft and right forehead to measure the oxygen saturation  respectively.  Both left and right external jugular venous \noxygen saturation  (SjvO 2) was collected after 10, 20, 30, and 40  min for comparison .  \nResults: As shown in Fig.2 , the predi cted rSO2 of the proposed neural network  was highly correlated with the true \nrSO2 of the cortex  compared to conventional spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS) algorithm . In in -vivo CCAO  \nmodel , both rSO 2 and SjvO 2 decreased during  occlusion and increased  after clamp -open  (Fig. 3) . Pearson correlation  \nanalysis between rSO 2 of NIRSIT -X and SjvO 2 yielded a significant positive correlation  (R2 = 0.41, p < 0.01) , but no \nsignificant correlation was found between rSO 2 of INVOS  and SjvO 2 (R2 = 0.12, p = 0.30) (Fig. 4). \nDiscussion : AI-assisted NIRS system significantly reduced superficial  contamination and was able to measure true \nrSO 2 in the cerebral cortex.   \n \nAcknowledgments  \nThis work was supported by \nthe Korea Medical Device \nDevelopment Fund grant \nfunded by the Korea \ngovernment (the Ministry of \nScience and ICT, the \nMinistry of Trade, Industry \nand Energy, the Ministry of \nHealth & Welfare, the \nMinistry of Food and Drug \nSafety) (Project Number: \n1711196547, RS -2023 -\n00242284)  \n291 of 398",

After the initial injury, inflammatory and cytotoxic responses to blood accumulation produce \ndamage to the surrounding tissue and promote the formation of perihematomal edema (PH E) [2]. PH E can cause \nmass effect and its rapid growth together with the hematoma can result in increase of intracranial pressure (ICP) \nwhich have been associated with poor prognosis since it can cause cerebral hypoperfusion due to impairment of \ncerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) leading to ischemia/hypoxia. We investigate the imple mentation of non -invasive \nmonitoring with diffuse optical techniques through different PH E evolution stages to evaluate its effect in cerebral \nhemodynamics and CVR for the prevention of secondary damage.  \nMethods: Clinical and radiological parameters  are evaluated  in patients with ICH  through different PHE evolution \nstages (1 -3 weeks)  includ ing NIHSS and Glasgow scales to measure stroke severity, ICH and PHE volume from \ncomputed tomography  (CT)  scans and s troke functional outcome evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) \nat three months after stroke onset.  On the same time of clinical and radiological evaluation we  use a hybrid diffuse \noptical device combining fast DCS and TD -NIRS to measure cerebral blood flow ( CBF) and  microvascular blood \noxygen satura tion (StO 2) respectively , and  simultaneously and continuously monitor heart rate, arterial blood \npressure, arterial oxygen saturation, end -tidal carbon -dioxide concentration, and respiratory rate.  Patients are \nmeasured continuously with the hybrid diffuse optical device while performing an orthostatic challenge modifying \nthe head -of-bed (HOB) angle from supine position to 30 degrees and back to supine. From the combination of \noptical and physiological data, we estimate dynamic CAR  indices using Pearson corr elation coefficients between \nCBF and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (DCSx) as well as StO 2 and MAP (COx) during each HOB position. \nFurthermore, we calculate cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen extraction fraction (CMRO 2), pulsatility  indices of \nCBF as well as static CAR estimation from the relation of changes in CBF with respect to changes in MAP.  \nResults: To date, 22 patients have been recruited.  Preliminary results  \nof 14/22 patients  shown in Fig. 1 exhibit  a significant relation \n(𝜌𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛= -0.55, p = 0.04) of  the relative cerebral blood flow \nresponse from first supine to second supine (ΔrCBF) to changes in \nMAP (ΔMAP) the day after patient’s admission  which could imply \nthat CVR  is impaired,  and the brain is at risk of secondary injuries . \nMoreover, using simple linear models we have not found significant \nrelation between hemodynamic parameters  (CBF, StO ₂, CMRO ₂, \nDCSx and COx ) at day 1 and the functional outcome evaluated by mRS . \nThe further analysis of the neuroimaging data is nece ssary to ev aluate \nwhether any single or a combination of the measured parameters can \ndetect PHE growth  and its prognostic implications . \nConclusion: We will continue recruiting patients to expand the information about the hemodynamic parameters \nand autoregulatory mechanisms in patients with PHE  and present detailed analysis of the evolution and interplay \nall the parameters compared to clinical and radiological findings.   \nAcknowledgments : Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Agencia Estatal de Investigación ( PHOTOMETABO, \nSAFEICP , Severo Ochoa, MEDLUX /LUXMED), Generalitat de Catalunya (CERCA, AGAUR, RIS3CAT), TV3  \nLa Marato, EC  (VASCOVID, TINYBRAINS, fastMOT, Prometeus), FEDER EC, LASERLAB -EUROPE, La \nCaixa LCF/BQ/DR23/12000034.  \nReferences:  [1] American Stroke Association.

    "MindJumper : A gamified neurofeedback interface  to \nincrease participant  engagement  \n \nDaniëlle Evenblij1, Janny Stapel1, Esther Keulers1, Michael Lührs2 & Bettina Sorger1 \n \n1Maastricht  University,  Maastricht, Netherlands;  2Brain Innovation  B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands  \nd.evenblij@maastrichtuniversity.nl , evenblij.d@gmail.com   \n \nAbstract:  To increase participant s’ motivation and engagement  during neurofeedback training , we \ndesigned a neurofeedback game  called “MindJumper”.  Users can choose an animal that will run and \ncollect coins: the better a user is able to regulate their brain activity, the higher the animal will jump. \nThe game will be made freely available for use and adaptation  in future neurofeedback studies.  \nIntroduction: Neurofeedback interfaces  are often based on abstract visual stimuli ( e.g., \nvertical bars)  that represent the up /down regulation of a brain region  [1]. Although  \nstraightforward , these designs might reduce participant engagement and can lead to mental \nfatigue in long paradigms with many sessions. We therefore designed a n intermittent \nneurofeedback interface  in the form of a jumping game aimed to keep participants engaged \nand motivated during  neurofeedback training.  \n \nMethods: The game was designed using the Python Pygame  library, structured within an \nObject -Oriented coding framework. It receives input from real -time fNIRS data -analysis \nsoftware Turbo -Satori [2] through Ex pyriment’s interface library [ 3] to calculate the \nneurofeedback signal . Triggers can be  sent through the LSL  library  and protocol files are \nautomatically  generated  for each run . The game exports  data on the collected fNIRS  signal \nfor each trial, as well as the achieved neurofeedback signal and number of coins collected. \nAdditionally, t he game can be put into simulation  mode to playback previously acquired \ndata. Experimental design parameters like task and rest  period duration can be adjusted \nbased on  the experimenter’s wishes . \n \nResults and conclusion : The MindJumper game is novel neurofeedback interface designed \nto keep participants motivated, focused  and engaged throughout neurofeedback training. \nAdditionally , the neurofeedback data that can be exported from it will contribute to \nreproducibility of future studies .

    "Optimizing spatial specificity and signal quality in fNIRS: \nAn overview of potential challenges and possible options for \nimproving reliability in real -time applications  \n \nFranziska Klein  \nBiomedical Devices and Systems Group, R&D Division Health, OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Germany   \nfranziska.klein@offis.de  \n \nAbstract:  fNIRS offers great potential for real -time applications such as neurofeedback (NFB) and \nbrain -computer interfaces (BCIs).  The aim here is to discuss the potential challenges and possible \noption for improvement, with a focus on increasing spatial specificity and signal quality to enhance \nthe reliability, reproducibility,  and repeatability of future fNIRS -based real -time applications. \nTopics include challenges in probe design, cap placement, and validation using high -resolution \ntechniques such as fMRI to improve spatial specificity. In addition, strategies to improve signa l \nquality, including methods to reduce noise such as motion artifacts and correct extracerebral \nsystemic activity in the context of real -time processing, are discussed.  \n \nIntroduction : In recent years, fNIRS has emerged as a promising tool for real -\ntime applications such as NFB and BCIs. Compared to fMRI, fNIRS offers \nadvantages such as portability, lower cost, enabling hemodynamic \nmeasurements in real -world environments, from bedsides to patients' homes. \nHowever, using fNIRS in real time presents challenges, including ensuring \nconsistent spatial specificity and maintaining high signal quality. Furthermore, \nreal-time fNIRS applications lag behind offline methods in terms of \ndevelopment, validation, standardization and reporting, making data \ninterpretation and reproducibility difficult. This methodologically focused \noverview  [1] discusses possible  options for  improvements in spatial specificity \nand signal quality that will be important for improving the reliability and \neffectiveness of  future  fNIRS -based real-time applications.  \n \nTopics: Two important aspects for improving fNIRS -based real -time applications are \ndiscussed: improving spatial specificity ( cf. Fig. 1) and signal quality ( cf. Fig. 2). In \nthis context, potenti al challenges,  and possible options regarding their applicability in \nreal-time contexts are considered . Regarding spatial specificity, discussions focus on \nprobe design, cap placement, and spatial validation using high -resolution methods such \nas fMRI. These factors are important for accurate and repeatable targeting of specific \nbrain regions.  To ensure that real -time applications are based on brain activity and not \nnoise, robust  signal quality is essential.  Regarding signal quality  improvement , possible  \nalgorithms that can be applied in real time, from signal quality assessment to noise \nreduction such as motion artifacts and extracerebral systemic activity , are considered .  \n \nConclusion:  High spatial specificity and robust signal quality are important factors for \nthe effectiveness and reliability of real -time fNIRS -based applications. Failure to take \nthese aspects into account could have a direct impact on the reliability of the signal and  \ntherefore on users' trust in these technologies.  Continuous development and rigorous \nvalidation of real -time methods are important for further development and ensuring \ntheir applicability in both clinical and research settings . In this context, the aim of this \noverview is to initiate an improvement and further development of future fNIRS -based \nreal-time applications  and methodology  regarding  spatial specificity and signal quality \nin order to increase their reliability, reproducibility and repeatability.  \n \nReferences  \n[1] Klein, F.

    "MultiPy: An open -source python  toolbox for  multimodal \nreal-time analysis  \n \nFranziska Klein1, Julien Räker1, Patrick Elfert1, Frerk Müller-von Aschwege1 & Andreas \nHein1,2 \n1Biomedical Devices and Systems Group, R&D Division Health, OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Germany   \n2Assistance Systems and Medical Technology  Group , Department of Health Services Research,  University of Oldenburg , Oldenburg, Germany  \nfranziska.klein@offis.de  \n \nAbstract:  MultiPy , an open -source Python toolbox, is currently being developed for real -time \npreprocessing and analysis of multimodal brain imaging data. MultiPy is intended to help improve \nneurofeedback (NFB) and brain -computer interface (BCI) applications, initially supp orting the \nintegration and combination of functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and \nelectroencephalography (EEG). With a user -friendly graphical user interface  (GUI)  and advanced \nanalysis modules, this toolbox aims to enable synchronous real -time p rocessing of various data \nstreams. By leveraging diverse Python libraries and promoting an inclusive open -source ethos, \nMultiPy enables community collaboration with the goal of facilitating access to real -time computing \ntechnology and accelerating progress  in the field.  \n \nIntroduction:  In the field of BCI and NFB, real -time analysis is essential for immediate interpretation and response \nto brain signals. So far, real-time applications typically used individual modalities such as EEG or fNIRS. However, \nintegrating fNIRS – which tracks blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain – and EEG  - which monitors the brain's \nelectrical activity  - could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of brain function. A multimodal approach could \nthus improve the accuracy and customization of  real-time applications , address challenges such as BCI illiteracy, and \nenable more personalized application. Despite these advantages, there is still no open -source toolbox for simultaneous \nreal-time analysis of fNIRS and EEG data. The MultiPy toolbox presented here is intended  to close this gap. Using \nPython provides the opportunity to take an inclusive, community -focused development approach with MultiPy, \nincreasing accessibility and driving advances in real -time multimodal analysis.  \n \nMethods: MultiPy is a GUI -based application designed to connect different modalities such as fNIRS and EEG across \ndevices that provide a Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) interface, enabling the integration of various time -synchronized \ndata acquisition systems for real -time data streaming.  The toolbox is currently divided into three main modules, each \nof which can be used individually or in combination:  \n1. fNIRS Module: This module enables real -time visualization and analysis of data. It supports multiple real -time \npreprocessing algorithms to improve data quality and reliability, including channel quality assessment, channel \ncleaning, conversion of raw light intensity dat a into hemoglobin concentration changes using the mBLL, motion \nartifact correction, temporal filtering, and extracerebral systemic activity correction  - available with or without \nshort -distance channels. Future updates aim to extend the GLM f iltering approach by incorporating additional \nLSL-compatible auxiliary measures through algorithms such as canonical correlation analysis to further refine \nthe model.  \n2. EEG Module: Beyond displaying data in real -time, this module includes key preprocessing steps such as artifact \nsubspace reconstruction and temporal filtering to ensure the reliability and usability of EEG data.  \n3. Feature Extraction & Machine Learning Module: This module focuses on extracting various time- and \nfrequency -domain features from fNIRS and EEG data, either individually or in combination. It leverages real -\ntime data -driven feature generation, for instance,  based on the time series of 𝛥[HbO] and 𝛥[HbR] data, and applies \nreal-time machine learning algorithms to  analyze and integrate features of both modalities.  \n \nConclusion:  The open -source Python toolbox MultiPy  is intended to enable multimodal data analysis in real time. By \nintegrating real -time fNIRS and EEG data, MultiPy aims to expand the application of NFB and BCI and make these \ntechnologies more accessible to the broader research community, thereby advancin g accessibility and standardization \nin this field. We invite the community to participate in the ongoing development and improvement of MultiPy. \nAdditionally, we encourage beta testers to experiment with our toolbox and provide valuable feedback to enable a \nuser-centered development approach.  295 of 398",
    "Exploring the activation of the r ight Temporoparietal \nJunction during mentalizing across species and agents  \nDorka Boda1, Ruud Hortensius1 \n \n1Department of Psychology,  Utrecht University, Heidelberglaan 1, 3584 CS,  Utrecht, The Netherlands  \nEmail: d.boda@uu.nl  \n \nAbstract:  What is the  involvement of the right Temporoparietal Junction (rTPJ) during mentalizing \nacross species and agents ? Using fNIRS, rTPJ activity was measured while participants ( analyzed  \nn = 16) had real -life interactions or observed screen -based interactions  with a human, AI, or dog , \nwith both tasks  triggering mentalizing . A channel -of-interest analysis revealed no significant \ndifferences in rTPJ activation across agents or tasks. While participants anthropomorphized the \nagents differently across tasks, this was not a consistent predictor of rTPJ activation. These first \nfindings suggest that mentalizing agents across tasks show clear distinct profiles at the behavioral  \nbut not  brain level.  \n \nIntroduction:  Mentalizing, the ability to infer intentions, beliefs, and emotions of other agents, is essential for \nsuccessful social interactions . The right Temporoparietal Junction (rTPJ) show s activation d uring mentalizing other \nhumans ; however, we do not only interact with other humans in our everyday lives, but also with other species (e.g., \npets) and agents  (e.g., AI voice assistant) . Yet, it remains unknown how mentalizing operates during those interactions \nand what role the rTPJ plays  in this.  Research so far  yield s mixed results , possible due to artificial task conditions \n(e.g., using computer -based observations) and restricted agent comparisons (e.g., comparing robots with humans \nonly). In the present study , we measured rTPJ activity  using fNIRS  during  mentalizing in  real-life and observed  \ninteractions with a human, AI voice assistant and dog. To account for explicit attributions made to the agents, we \ninclud ed situational anthropomorphism  (the attribution of  humanlike characteristics to t he agent during the interaction ) \nas a possible predictor of rTPJ activity.  \nMethods:  A total of 22 participants were recruited for the study (analyzed  n = 16). The study followed a within -\nsubject design with two factors: agent (human, dog, AI  voice assistant ) and task type (computer task, real -life \ninteraction ). A NIRx NIRSport2 portable fNIRS with a 12 -channel configuration was placed over the rTPJ . Data \nanalysis was carried out in MNE Python 1.6.1 and R. Using a  validated Theory -of-Mind network localizer  we \nemployed a channel -of-interest analyses . For the subject -specific channel -of-interest, 10s segments were extracted to \nmeasure mentalizing -related concentration changes of HbO.  A linear mixed model was built with task and agent as \nfixed effects  and with random intercepts for task, agent,  and participant.   \nResults: The activity of the rTPJ did not vary significantly across task s [F(1,74.27) = 0.22, p = .639 ] and agents \n[F(2,28.96) = 0.79 , p = .786]. No interaction was found between tasks and agents [ F(2,74.19 ) = 0.47,  p = .626]. While \na significant main effect of agent on the behavioral measure of situational anthropomorphism was found [ F(2,15) = \n77.32 , p = < .001 ; human and dog > AI voice assistant ], situational anthropomorphism was not a consistent predictor \nof rTPJ activity [ F(1,85) = 0.57, p = .453 ].   \nConclusion:  Our study investigated the differences of rTPJ activity during mentalizing across species and agents  in \nreal-life and computer -based situations , and the  potential  influence of situational anthropomorphism. While behavioral \nmeasures of situational anthropomorphism revealed significant differences among agents, our fNIRS analysis  did not \nalign with  these distinctions  at the level of rTPJ activity.  To better understand the role of the rTPJ, and the Theory -of-\nMind network at large, it is crucial to \nmeasure activity during real -life situations \nand include a wide range of agents. \nUltimately, this  approach can help us better \nunderstand the underlying mechanisms of \nsocial interactions . \n \n \nAcknowledgements:  \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge \nfunding  from the Open Science Fund from \nUtrecht University.  \n  \nFigure: Participants interacted with  a dog, a human and an AI \nvoice assistant in real -life and computer tasks.  \n296 of 398",

Patients with craniosynostosis (N=1 0) were monitored using \ntime resolved  (TRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscop ies (DCS) measurements taken the night \nbefore and 6 -8 months after cranial vault remodeling . The study looked at changes in cerebral \noxygenation and blood flow before and after surgery, with the aim of further understanding the \nrelationship between potentially alte red intracranial pressure  on cerebral  hemodynamics  and oxygen \nmetabolism . \n \nIntroduction : Craniosynostosis is a congenital condition where the bones of a baby’s skull fuse too early, causing \ncompression and crowding of the brain. Patients with craniosynostosis often exhibit alterations in intracranial pressure \n(ICP) and cerebral blood flow (C BF), which might lead to inadequate oxygen supply to the brain. Surgical intervention \nis typically necessary to correct the skull and prevent neurological damage. Non -invasive monitoring before and after \nsurgery is crucial to understand how these cranial m alformations affect CBF and oxygenation. Hybrid, near -infrared \ndiffuse optical monitoring with TRS and DCS allow us to monitor both perfusion and oxygen consumption in a non -\ninvasive continuous manner.  \nMethods: The study inclusion criteria were as follows : (1) children with a diagnosis of craniosynostosis, (2 ) clinical  \nindica tion for surgical correction, and (3) availability to attend for follow -up monitoring. The parents were asked for \nwritten informed consent before the inclusion. Clinical protocol : Children were evaluated  at the Pediatric \nNeurosurgical Unit of the Neurosurgical Department at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital . The neurosurgeon \ndetermines the indication for surgery and establishes the operative strategy, according to the type of sutu res involved \nin the specific case.  Nighttime measurements of 2 -5 hours are conducted before and after surgery. The first one is \ntaken the night prior to surgery while the second one is done 6 -8 months later. Research suggests that the maximum \nimprovement i n the volumetric capacity of the skull, relative to the age and cranial development of the child, can be \nobserved within this period , hence we focus on hemodynamic  and intracranial dynamics during this period . Two \nprobes were placed bilaterally above  the eyebrows to monitor  the frontal lobes . \nResults: Twenty  measurements from 1 0 patients pre - and post -\nsurgery were  analyzed . The median preoperative age was 11 \nmonth s, with 70% of the cases consisting  of single suture \ncraniosynostosis. Time-traces of CBF  index (CBFi), total \nhemoglobin concentration (THC) and tissue oxygen saturation \n(StO2)  were obtained . By  combining the two techniques, we \nestimated  oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic \nrate of oxygen  (CMRO 2). As shown in Figure 1, and as expected, \nthe representative results of CBFi changes show significant \nheterogeneity.  As the study population grows, we will present a  \ndetailed analysis that accounts for inter -subject differences such as \nthe type of craniosynostosis,  sex, age, and  the specific surgical \ntechniques . \n Acknowledgments : Agencia Estatal de Investigación (PHOTOMETABO, SAFEICP, Severo Ochoa, \nMEDLUX/LUXMED), Gen eralitat de Catalunya (CERCA, AGAUR, RIS3CAT), TV3 La Marató, EC  (VASCOVID, \nTINYBRAINS, fastMOT, Prometeus), FEDER EC, LASERLAB -EUROPE, NIH R01NS090874, AGAUR \n2021SGR/00810.

    "Beyond the general linear model: comparing fNIRS data \nanalysis procedures for assessing shared processing of \nauditory narratives  \n \nParsa Fani -Molky, Sergio Novi,  Matthew Kolisnyk, Reza Moulavi Ardakani,  Adrian M. Owen \nThe Department of Physiology and Pharmacolog y, Western University , London Canada  \nPresenting Author email address: pfanimo@uwo.ca  \n \nAbstract:  Leveraging the mobility of functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may enable \nnovel experimental designs and clinical tools. However, it remains unclear whether fNIRS can \ndetect narrative -induced frontoparietal synchronization, a correlate for higher -level processing. We \ncompared three common analysis approaches: pairwise intersubject correlation (ISC), leave -one-\nout ISC,  and the general linear model (GLM) on 29 healthy participants (15 female, 20 - 48 years \nold) attending to a 15 -minute auditory paradigm. Only pairwise ISC detected group -level narrative -\ninduced frontoparietal synchrony. Pairwise ISC also demonstrated grea ter subject -level sensitivity \nthan leave -one-out ISC and the GLM. These findings illustrate the potential of fNIRS ISC for future \napplications.  \n \nIntroduction:  FNIRS is an emerging neuroimaging tool with promising potential in clinical and research applications. \nHowever, fNIRS research lacks standardization, limiting the reproducibility and impact of findings. For instance, the \ngeneral linear model (GLM) and inte rsubject correlation (ISC) are two prominent approaches for assessing group - and \nsubject -level responses to stimuli. Importantly, the GLM assesses whether an individual fits a pre -defined \nhemodynamic response function, while ISC analysis compares an indivi dual to other subjects, assessing for \nsynchronized time series. Consequently, these procedures feature different assumptions and limitations. However, it \nremains unclear how these differences impact the interpretation of complex stimuli, such as the shared processing of \nnarratives.  \n \nMethods: To conduct this study, twenty -nine healthy volunteers ( 15 females, 20 -48 years old ) attended to a 15 -minute \nauditory paradigm. The paradigm included  five blocks of  three 30 -second conditions , including  stories with complex \nlanguage  and pseudowords matched to the structure of the stories , which are  compared  to measure semantic \nprocessing . FNIRS data were acquired with  a continuous -wave system (NIRScoutXP, NIRx  Medical Systems; Berlin, \nGermany) with 32 sources and 39 detectors,  resulting in 121 regular (~3cm) channels and 8 short (<0.8cm) channels . \nThe data was pre -processed to correct for motion artifacts  using spline interpolation followed by wavelet \ndecomposition , band-pass filter ed with a low pass filter of 0.5 Hz, detrend ed, and short -channel s were regress ed. Three \nanalysis procedures were compared at the group and subject level: the GLM, pairwise ISC (comparing all possible \ncombinations of subjects), and le ave-one-out ISC (comparing each subject with the group’s average time series). The \nanalysis focused on detecting synchronized frontoparietal brain regions in the story minus pseudoword conditions, \nindicating shared language comprehension. Permutation testing was conducted to account for multiple comparisons.  \n \nResults: In the group -level analysis of language comprehension, only pairwise ISC demonstrated significant \nsynchrony in frontoparietal brain regions. In the subject -level analysis of language comprehension, pairwise ISC \ndetected significant frontoparietal synchrony  in 19 out of 29 participants (66 percent)  compared to 16 out of 29 \nparticipants (55 percent) for leave -one-out and 14 out of 29 participants (48 percent) with the GLM. Moreover, \npairwise ISC detected significantly more synchronized frontoparietal channels per subject than leave -one-out ISC and \nthe GLM.  \n \nConclusion:  Despite the present study’s b lock design being initially intended for analysis using  the GLM , at both the \ngroup and subject level , pairwise ISC  was more sensitive to  hemodynamic responses associated with language \ncomprehension  than the GLM and leave -one-out ISC. Overall, s ubject -level sensitivity is a major concern for clinical \napplications  of neuroimaging narrative paradigms, such as diagnosis and prognosis of unresponsive brain injury \npatients. Further optimization of experimental design and procedures, leveraging the temporal resolution of fNIRS \nand ISC approaches, may particularly benefi t these applications. Likewise, our findings highlight pairwise ISC's \npotential  for experimental designs with complex stimuli, such as those used in social and cognitive neuroscience \nresearch.  298 of 398",
    "Feasibilityof Simultaneous NearWhole-HeadfNIRS and\nPhysiologicalMeasurements\nJoãoPereira*1,SophieRaible*2,MichaelLührs2,3,TeresaSousa1,,BrunoDireito4,ZeusTipado2,\nJacquelineGädtke5, BettinaSorger2,MiguelCastelo-Branco1,2,RainerGoebel2,3\n1University of Coimbra, CIBIT-ICNAS;2Maastricht University, Maastricht Brain Imaging Center, Department of Cognitive Neuroscience,\n3Brain Innovation, The Netherlands;4University of Coimbra, CISUC;5RWTH Aachen University, Germany\n*shared first co-authors; jpereira@uc.pt\nAbstract: Non-cerebral and physiological systemic activity contaminates fNIRS data and\ncould account for the considerable across-subject variability reported in the literature. Aiming\nto evaluate global systemic physiology's influence, we have designed an fNIRS task battery\ncombined with simultaneous peripheral physiological measurements. Preliminary data quality\nresults validate the feasibility of this multimodal setup toward a larger dataset to be published\nand openly available for the fNIRS community.\nIntroduction: fNIRS has emerged as a functional neuroimaging alternative to measure hemodynamic cortical\nbrain responses. Nonetheless, a lack of reproducibility and high inter-subject variability of cortical activation\npatterns have been reported, which might be partially attributed to changes in global systemic physiology1.W e\naim to generate a dataset that allows for evaluating the impact of individual external physiological\nmeasurements on the hemodynamic responses from different brain regions during resting, motor, emotion\nrecognition, visual, and music-listening tasks. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of the paradigm in an initial\nsubset of participants.\nMethods: We acquired fNIRS data from 7 healthy participants, using two cascaded NIRSport2 systems with a\n32 sources x 28 detectors near whole-head montage and 32 short-distance detectors (SDD) (8 mm), sampled at\n12.6 Hz. We simultaneously recorded respiration, heart rate, electromyography (EMG), pulse oximetry (PPG),\nelectrocardiography (ECG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) with the NIRx Wings module (Figure 1). As\nquality metrics, and according to fNIRS best practices2, the Signal-to-Noise (SNR), Coefficient of Variance\n(CV%), Scalp Coupling Index (SCI), as well as average heart and breathing rate were selected for reporting.\nResults: Data quality varied substantially between participants, but was overall acceptable (Figure 1). Using an\nSCI of 0.75 as a channel exclusion criterion, 12.82 ± 14.71% of channels and 12.95 ± 12.72% of SDD channels\nwould have been excluded per run and participant. There was no significant difference in data quality between\neach session's first and last run (p SNR= 0.54; p CV= 0.58). After manual outlier removal, overall satisfactory data\nquality was present, with SNR of the physio data of mean SNR-Resp = 41.32 ± 3.33dB; mean SNR-ECG = 24.31 ± 10.67\ndB; mean SNR-PPG = 41.45 ± 12.1 dB; mean SNR-GSR = 27.9 ± 12.36 dB, and with average heart rate measured across\nall participants and runs of mean HR= 68.83 ± 10.35, and the breathing rate of mean BR= 17.71 ± 3.24 rpm.\nConclusion: The feasibility of simultaneously recording near whole-head fNIRS and physiological responses\nwas shown. Obtained results motivate the continuing collection of a larger dataset to be made available to the\nfNIRS community.\nFigure 1. a. Example of physiological data from one run. b.

    "Mediating role of the age-specific prefrontal activation in the \nrelationship between aerobic fitness and working memory in \nthe elderly  \n \nKazuki Hyodoa, Ippeita Danb, Takashi Jindoa,c, Kiyomitsu Niiokab,d, Hideaki Soyae, and \nTakashi Araoa \n \na Physical fitness institute, Meiji Yasuda Life Foundation of Health and Welfare, Tokyo, Japan  \nb Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan  \n cSpecial  Appointed Lecturer, Division of Art, Music, and Physical Education, Osaka Kyoiku University, Osaka 582 -0026, Japan  \nd Department of Physiological Science, The University of Human Environments, Ehime, 790 -0005, Japan  \ne Laboratory of Exercise Biochemistry and Neuroendocrinology, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan  \n \nk-hyodo@my -zaidan.or.jp  \n \nAbstract:  This study sought to identify prefrontal activation pattern s mediating the relationship \nbetween aerobic fitness and working memory performance in older adults  using functional near \ninfrared spectroscopy, and verbal and spatial n -back task . We found that older adults exhibited \nextended prefrontal activation during  2-back conditions compared to younger adults, and that age -\nspecific prefrontal activation during the verbal 2 -back condition was associated with higher aerobic \nfitness and better verbal 2 -back performance. These results suggest that older adults with highe r \naerobic fitness levels recruit more extended PFC regions, possibly for compensatory activation, to \nenhance the n-back task performance .  \n \nIntroduction:  Many  studies have found the association between  higher aerobic fitness and better working memory \n(WM) performance in older adults. However, the functional neural mechanisms of this association are still being \nexplored . Several studies reported that older adults have recruited additional prefrontal region during working memory \ntask compared to young adults, this extended activation  is associated with task performance in a compensatory manner. \nTherefore, this study  aimed  to identify   prefrontal activation pattern s mediati ng the relationship  between aerobic \nfitness and working memory performance in older adults , focusing on age -related extended prefrontal recruitment.  \nMethods: Forty -seven older adults (65 -74 years, 29 females) and forty -nine younger adults (18 -24 years, 23 female) \nunderwent  verbal and spatial n -back tasks  with 0-,1-, and 2 -back conditions. Reaction time (RT) and accuracy (ACC) \nwere measured to evaluate  task performance. Task-related p refrontal activation was monitored using  multichannel  \nfunctional near -infrared spectroscopy and analyzed with an adaptive GLM method1. Task performance and prefrontal \nactivation were compared between age groups to identify  age-related prefrontal activation patterns. Only the older \ngroup  conducted  a graded exercise test (GXT) to measur  ventilation thresholds (VT) as an index  of aerobic fitness . \nSubsequently, correlation and mediation analysis were conducted to clarify the relationships among aerobic fitness, \nn-back task performance, and prefrontal activation in older adults controlling for possible covariates.  \nResults: Compared to younger adults,  older adults demonstrated  slower RT and lower ACC , particularly  in the higher \nWM load 2 -back condition. Group comparisons of task-related prefrontal activation showed that older adults recruited \nadditional and greater activation than younger adults , especially  in the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and front polar \narea (FPA) during  both the verbal and spatial 2 -back conditions. Correlation analysis exhibited  a relationship between \nhigher VT, shorter RT for the verbal 2 -back condition, and greater prefrontal activation of the bilateral FPA and right \nVLPFC during verbal 2 -back conditions in older adults.  Additionally , mediation analyses suggested that the age-\nrelated prefrontal activation might mediate the association  between VT and RT for the verbal 2 -back condition2. \nConclusion:  The findings suggest that older adults with higher aerobic fitness levels recruit  additional  PFC regions, \nlikely as a compensatory manner , to improve their performance of the verbal n -back task.

    "How Self-Disclosure in Stuttering  Had an Effect on \nCommunication Perception: an fNIRS Analysis  \nMaria Monteleone1, Alysa Robinson1, Megan Roman1, Samantha Delmar1, Sergio Novi2, Glen Tellis1, and \nRickson C. Mesquita3,* \n1 Department of Speech -Language Pathology, Misericordia University , Dallas, Pennsylvania, USA . \n2 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology , Western University, London, Canada.  \n3 School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.  \n * Corresponding  author : r.c.mesquita@bham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  We investigated neural changes in typically fluent speakers when viewing people who \nstutter (PWS) . Our results indicate that watching videos where PWS self -disclose their stuttering \nelicited reduced activation in brain regions related to language comprehension and emotional \nprocessing, suggesting a decreased cognitive and emotional load for viewers.  \nBackground : Stuttering  can trigger a range of negative reactions that may have an effect on  communication between \nthe speaker and the listener.  Previous research has indicated that openly disclosing one’s stuttering can significantly \nimprove how listeners perceive people who stutter ( PWS ) [1,2] . Such acknowledgment positively impacts perceptions  \nand reduces perceived stigma. This study aimed to investigate the neural dynamics involved  during this process, \nexamining how brain responses in typically fluent speakers (TFS) differ when they are informed about the stutter  \ncompared to when it remains undisclosed.  \nMethods: A total of 1 2 TFSs  aged 18 to 23 (5 females) participated in this study . Participants were asked to watch \neight randomized  videos featuring PWS with moderate stuttering. Half of the videos included self -disclosure of \nstuttering at the start, while the other half did not. The videos were presented in a block -design paradigm consisting \nof 20 -s duration interleaved with 15 -s rest  intervals. We employed a CW fNIRS system (NIRScout, NIRx Medical \nTechnologies) containing 16 sources and 16 detectors , provid ing 28 channels and 2 short channels. The optical probe \ncovered parts of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes . The fNIRS  data were corrected for motion artifacts  \n(SNR < 8) , band -pass filtered  (0.005 – 0.5 Hz) , and neural activation was inferred at a channel level using a GLM \n(AR-IRLS ) that incorporated short channels as regressors  to minimize  the effects of extracortical  physiolog y. Both \nsingle - and group -level  statistical analyses were performed on the GLM beta values for HbO and HbR, with statistical \nsignificance assessed at a level of 0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons. At the end of the study, participants  \nwere asked to  complete a survey to establish perceptions about self -disclosure.  \nResults: When participants watched the videos,  we found significant activation in  cortical regions responsible for \nvisual processing, face  recognition, language comprehension and semantic processing , and social and emotional \nprocessing , regardless of whether stuttering was disclosed . However, when testing the effect of self -disclosure in the \ntrials, we observed that videos that included self -disclosure at the beginning demonstrated reduced activation in the \ntemporal gyrus, which is associated with language comprehension and semantic processing, and the temporal pole, \nlinked to social and emotional processing. The survey results indicated that participants experienced a slightly higher \nlevel of discomfort when watching videos without the use of self -disclosure.  \nConclusion:  The f NIRS findings reveal  that brain regions involved in language and emotion al processing show \nincreased activation in response to stimuli . Notably, t he reduced activation  observed during self -disclosure  trials \nsuggests  that such disclosure s might  decrease  cognitive load for listeners engaging with PWS. Specifically, the lower \nactivation in areas responsible for emotional and social processing could indicate a more relaxed and less stress ful \nlistener  response during conversations with PWS, which might explain the positive perceptions documented in \nprevious behavioral studies. Overall, these results have implications for speech -language pathologists , reinforcing the \npractice of encouraging their clients to self -disclose their stuttering at the beginning of conversations  to improve \ncommunication effectiveness  [3].  \n[1] Boyle, M.P. et al.

    "A Convolutional Network Model for the Quality Evaluation \nof fNIRS signals.  \n \nAlexander Caicedo1,3, Uzair Hakim2, Natalie Gunasekara2, Ilias Tachtsidis2 \n \n1 Department of Electronic Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia  \n2 Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, London, UK  \n3 Ressolve S.A.S., Medellín, Colombia  \nCorresponding Author : uzair.hakim.17@ucl.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Currently there are no standards for the evaluation of the quality of fNIRS  signals. In this \nwork we propose the use of a convolutional neural network, trained to classify fNIRS measurements \nas good or bad quality. For each channel, the  network uses  HbO2 and HHb signals as input, and \nprovides  binary classification  as an output . The trained data was obtained from 51 subjects, and it \nwas manually labelled by experts as a good or a bad channel. Results indicate an accuracy of 80% \nwhen the model cl assifies an input observation as a good or a bad channel.  \n  \nIntroduction:  The evaluation of the quality of fNIRS signals is important to guarantee that the post -hoc analysis is \nbased upon real measurements, and not noise or segments largely contaminated with artefacts. However, there is not \na standardization for this procedure, which can impact the reproducibility of the studies reported in the literature . \nCurrently, different groups apply different criteria in order to select a measurement  as good or bad quality. Among \nthese criteria the more used are: (i) the absence of a heartbeat oscillation; (ii) poor photon intensity detection; and (iii) \npositive correlation between HbO2 and HHb.  In this work we aim at developing a neural network model, that takes \nas input the HbO2 and HHb signal, to produce as output a binary classification which indicates if the measurements \nare of good or bad quality.  \nMethods: We used data from 51 subjects  who took part in a block moving task . The data was obtained using a \ncontinuous wave system, LABNIRS System (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan ). This system emits lights at 780nm, \n805nm, and 830nm at a sampling frequency of 7.4Hz, and measures 44 channels. The optodes were arranged covering \nthe bilateral temporoparietal junctions. The recording time for each participant  was around 20 minutes. We used each \nchannel as an observation, which results in a total of 2244 observation s. Data were preprocessed according to fNIRS \nbest practices.  Each channel was manually annotated by experts as a “good” or a “bad” channel , using a traffic light \nsystem on the raw intensity and concentration change data .  \nFor the model we trained a n 1D-Convolutional neural network, the network consists of three blocks of convolutional \nlayers with RELU activation functions, followed by maxpool layers, and finally the classifier is a feedforward neural \nnetwork with 4 layers, using a RELU as activation function in hidden layers and a softmax function in the output layer , \nas shown in the figure . The input data has dimensions of 8999x2, representing the samples within 20 minutes of data \nin the first dimension, and the HbO2 and t he HHb signals in the second dimension. The blocks of convolutional and \nmaxpool layers can be interpreted as non -linear filters that are learn to identify patterns that facilitate the classification \ntask, i.e., these blocks act as a feature extractor. In o ur network architecture, after passing through the convolutional \nblocks, the input data is compressed to a single vector of 360 elements, this vector is then processed forward through \nthe classifier to produce the final output.  \nFrom the 51 subjects, measurements from 40 \nsubjects were used to train the 1D -CNN, a total of \n1760 observations, and 11 were used to test the \nmodel performance, a total of 484 observations.  \nIn this way we can guarantee not only that our \nmodel has sufficient data to be trained, but we also \nguarantee that the training and test data contain \nmeasurements from different subjects.  \nResults: Preliminary results indicate an accuracy of around 80% when the model classifies an input observation as a \ngood or a bad channel, and a 20% of false positive and negative rate . \nConclusion:  We have shown that a model based on a convolutional neural network  is able to classify a measurement \nas of good or bad quality. We are currently working in improving model performance via incorporating more data and \nadapting the network architecture . We are aiming to develop a tool that can be used as a standard to validate the quality \nof fNIRS signals.   \nFigure 1. Neural Network Architecture  \n302 of 398",
    "Neural mechanisms of BeMim: what brain mechanism drives the link \nbetween liking and mimicry?  \n \nPaula Wicher, Antonia Hamilton  \n \nInstitute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL , 17-19 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AZ United Kingdom  \npaula.wicher.20@ucl.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  To explore the impact of being mimicked (BeMim) on liking and affiliation, we tracked neural activity using Light NIRS  and \nmeasured liking effects with questionnaires  in two participant groups (N=62) experiencing distinct mimicry types: Choice and Motor. \nBehavioural findings demonstrated a robust liking effect for Choice BeMim, and this was reflected in activation patterns with in TPJ. \nConversely, for Motor BeMim, we identified a subtle behavioural liki ng effect with activation in right and left Angular Gyrus and right \nSTS.  \n \nIntroduction:  Being mimicked (BeMim), the state of having your own actions \ncopied by another person, is believed to lead to liking and affiliation (Chartrand \n& Bargh, 1999; Lakin & Chartrand, 2003) . Our previous study showed that this \nis also true for copying choices. However, what is stronger likeability driver – \ncopying body movements or preferences and do they engage with similar neural \nmechanisms? To understand the neural and cognitive mechanisms behind \nBeMim effect s, we used fNIRS to track brain activity in two groups of \nparticipants experiencing different types of mimicry.  \n \nMethods: 63 participants (54 females, 9 males) were assigned to either Motor or \nChoice BeMim group. In the Choice BeMim condition, participants pointed to a \npainting and then saw a confederate who liked the same/different painting. \nConversely, in the Motor BeMim participants pointed to a painting and then saw \na confederate make the same/different arm movement to another painting.  Each \nparticipant completed 30 trials with a confederate who copied their choice or \nmovement on 75% of trials, and 30 trials with a different confederate who did \nnot copy . Throu ghout these interactions,  brain activity in the temporal and \nparietal cortex was continuously recorded using a Shimadzu LightNIRS device . \nLiking effects were assessed with questionnaires and fNIRS data was analysed \nwith a NIRS -SPM  based on CBSI signal . \n \nResults: Behavioural findings demonstrated  that participants prefer confederates \nwho mimic their choices, and this was  reflected in activation patterns within the  \nleft temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Conversely, for Motor BeMim, we identified \na subtle behavioural liking effect with activation in right and left Angular Gyrus \nand the right superior temporal sulcus (STS).  \n \nConclusion:  We find that mimicry of choices had robust behavioural effects but \nonly weak brain activations in the areas of cortex sampled.  However, mimicry \nof movements was linked to clear brain effects in right angular gyrus which \nrelates to previous work linking this area to motor coordination and the sense of \nself (Farrer et al., 2008) . This provides the first neuroimaging study of the mechanisms by which mimicry causes people to like each \nother in the context of real face -to-face social interactions . \n \n \nReferences  \nChartrand, T.

Capable of \nprocessing MAs  across 12 channels in just 2.75 ms, our FPGA design supports potential \nenhancements through deep learning integration. This advancement is especially relevant for future \nwearable devices, brain -computer interfaces (BCI), and neurofeedback applications,  enabling \nessential real -time analysis.  \n \nIntroduction:  Acquiring accurate fNIRS/DOT data is often impeded by the presence of MAs  and the lack of real -\ntime detection and filtering. An FPGA is a chip -scaled integrated circuit that offers real -time parallel processing \ncapabilities and reconfigurable hardware flexibility1. Therefore, FPGA has the potential to be implemented for real -\ntime MA detection on the fly.  \nMethods: Twelve -channel fNIRS raw data from a LUMO system were manually labeled by experienced researchers \nto identify motion artifacts2. The traditional HomER2 MA detection method3 was modified to calculate adjacent \ndifferences, signal variance, and maximum difference within a time window in real -time. All processing modules were \nencoded in Verilog for FPGA development.   \nResults: The MA  detection system achieved a processing time of 2.754 ms  per sample across 12 channels. In \ncomparison with the traditional HomER2 method, this system demonstrated a median accuracy of 74.62%, slightly \nlower than the 81.17% achieved by the traditional approach. However, the sensitivity of the system, defined as the \nability to correctly identify actual motion artifacts, significantly improved from 83.12% to 91.68%.  \nConclusion:  The enhanced sensitivity of the real -time MA detection system showcases improved accuracy in \nidentifying MAs during actual fNIRS/DOT experiments. The system also show s promising processing speeds for \nfNIRS/DOT signals. With further system design optimizations and integration of deep learning methods, this system \ndemonstrates significant potential for efficient and reliable multichannel real -time motion artifact detectio n. \n1.

    "Mother-child inter -brain synchrony during mothers’ \nemotional support imagery  \n \nInrs Rodrigues1,2,*, João Pereira2, Diana Costa2, Bruno Direito3,2, Marco Sim}es3,2, Pascal Vrticka4, Teresa \nSousa2, Miguel Castelo -Branco1,2 \n \n1 Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal 2Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research \n(CIBIT -ICNAS), University of Coimbra , Coimbra, Portugal3 Center for Informatics and Systems (CISUC), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, \nPortugal 4 Centre for Brain Science, Department of Psychology, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom  \n*E-mail: ines.rodrigues@student.uc.pt      \n \nAbstract:  The mother -child relationship plays a central role in the development of children’s \nemotion regulation (ER) skills. Inter -brain synchrony (IBS) is believed to reflect dyadic ER \nprocesses in parent -child interactions. We used functional near -infrared spect roscopy (fNIRS)  \nhyperscanning to measure IBS in mother -child dyads during emotional imagery of mothers’ support \nto test this hypothesis. IBS was higher in positive situations imagined with (vs. without) each other. \nOur results suggest that IBS reflects mot her-child emotional sharing, and depends on the social \ncontext and valence of the experiences. Future work involves studying the association of IBS with \npsychological measures.  \n \nIntroduction:  Childhood is a critical period for developing ER skills, a process importantly shaped by the mother -\nchild relationship1. It has been suggested that IBS is related to neural mechanisms of co -regulation as part of dyadic \nER2 and that it can be influence d by stimulus emotional valence and social context3. Here, we tested this hypothesis \nby investigating IBS during imagery of mother’s support to the child in shared emotionally loaded experiences.  \n \nMethods: We used fNIRS hyperscanning to concurrently measure brain activity in the right frontopolar cortex, \ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), and temporo -parietal junction (rTPJ) in 39 mother -child (child ages 10 to \n14) dyads (18 channels per participant). Participants were seated back to back and performed an emotional imagery \ntask.  The situations presented  directly targeted the child (with the mother serving as an emotional support figure) and \nvaried in valen ce (positive, negative, and neutral) and social context ( participants were asked to imagine how they \nwould feel being with/without each other). IBS was derived by applying wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis \nto the HbO data after motion correction, bandpass filtering [0.01-0.50] Hz, and z-normalization. Statistical analyses \nwere performed using general linear mixed models (GLMM) with social context and valence as both fixed and \ninteracting factors. We calculated a GLMM for each brain area and corrected the p-values for multiple comparisons \nusing False Discovery Rate (FDR).  \n \nResults: A significant interaction between social context and valence was found in rTPJ (X2(2) = 7.0367, padjusted  = \n0.04) . The interaction emerged because imagining being with (vs. without) each other in positive situations elicited \nhigher IBS in rTP J. Additional analyses comparing true versus random pairs are still being computed.  \n \nConclusion:  Our results suggest that IBS may reflect the neural mechanisms of co -regulation in mother -child dyads  \nand that it depends on the social context and valence of their experiences. Furthermore, the effect of the social context \nseems to be more evident in rTPJ, consistent with the hypothesis that rTPJ is involved in perspective -taking4. Ongoing \nwork involves studying the association between IBS and psychological measures to better interpret our results.  \n \nReferences:  \n1. Cooke, J. E., Kochendorfer, L.

    "Deep Learning-based prediction of superficial layer depth \nand optical properties in fNIRS \n \nL. Y. L. Chan1, R. Dale1, O. Abdalsalam2, N. Ross2, T. O’Sullivan2 and H. Dehghani1 \n \n1School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK   \n2University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA  \nh.dehghani@bham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Superficial layer thickness and optical properties often confound the ability of fNIRS to \nprovide accurate prediction of the derived hemodynamic response of the brain from measurements. \nA methodology based on Deep Learning  is presented , trained on noise -added simulated data, \ndemonstrating accurate recovery of the unknown depth and optical properties of two layer \nphantom s, using experimental measurements. It is shown to out -perform classical optimization \napproaches, demonstrating the advantages of data -driven approaches for parameter recovery.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional Near -infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an advanced non -invasive functional  imaging \ntechnique that utilizes light transmission  measurements through tissue  together with  data analysis tools (often machine \nlearning -based optimization ) to derive  the tissues’ optical properties and hemoglobin concentrations . This technology \nis used to measure and derive functional changes within the brain due to some stimuli. However, as the light propagate s \nthrough superficial tissues before sampling the brain, the unknown optical properties and layer thickness often \nconfound the ability of fNIRS to provide quantitative measures of the signal. In this work, a Deep Learning (DL) \napproach is introduced  for simultaneous optical parameter recovery as well as unknown layer thickness and evaluated \nin phantom measurements and compared to conventional least-square curve fitting  (LSF). \nMethods: A fully connected neural network is utilized to estimate not only the optical  properties of a two -layer model \nbut also the depth (thickness) of the superficial  layer with a simple  instrumentation setup (one source and four \ndetectors), proving that neural network has the  capacity to solve the challenges in multi -layered fNIRS . It is a fully \nconnected neural network  with one input  layer, five fully connected layers with 64 neurons each and an output layer.  \nNIRFAST [2] was used to simulate Frequency Domain data (amplitude and phase) for a 2 -layer 3D model, for a range \nof optical properties for each layer and layer thickness varying between 3 -10 mm, with a total of 20,000 datasets. To \nfurther improve the robustness and address real -world scenarios, we added noise  to our simulated dataset. While \ntraining and testing our model with noise -free data  provide a baseline for evaluation, incorporating noise to train our \nmodel allows us to better  understand the performance of the model . Two experimental two -layer phantom data with \ndifferent sets of optical properties and depths  equal  to 5 mm and 10 mm were  collected by a FD system  [1] with \nmeasurements cover ing a wide range of frequencies from  50-500 MHz and multiple lasers with different wavelengths. \nData with a frequency of 99.5 MHz and a wavelength equal to 828 nm  was utilized  from a single source and 4 detectors \nranging from 10 mm to 25 mm. \nResults: The results are summarized in Table 1. It is shown that the DL algorithm provides higher accuracy for \nparameter recovery, whereas classical LSF approaches often fail due to lack of assumed feature fitting. Although the \nrecovered layer thickness shows the highest error, this approach of training models on noise -added simulated data \nshows a high promise.  \nTable 1: Derived parameters (mm-1) using experimental data for both DL and LSF  \n \nConclusion:  Optical parameter recovery  using simulated, noise added data provide the means of more accurate \nparameter recovery using DL, paving the way towards quantitative fNIRS, overcoming superficial layer signal \ncontamination.  \nReferences:  \n[1] Abdalsalam, O. et al.

    "Using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to \nDetect Neurocognitive Differences Across Social Drinking \nPatterns  \nRebecca Kuiper1, Stephen Fairclough1, Harry Sumnall1, & Catharine Montgomery1 \n1 School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK .  \nPresenting Author email address: r.kuiper@2020.ljmu.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Research exploring the relationship between alcohol consumption levels and cortical \nfunctioning often use  traditional neuroimaging techniques, yet  fNIRS  has seen little utilisation . This \nstudy aims to test the utility of fNIRS in detecting differences  in prefrontal cortex ( PFC) \nhaemodynamics across social drinking levels during executive function performance. fNIRS \nmeasured the PFC h aemodynamics of thirty -nine social drinkers during compl etion of four \nexecutive function ing tasks . There were no performance differences between the light and hazardous \ndrinking groups and  ongoing analysis  has produced  limited eviden ce for differences in PFC activit y. \nThis study  contributes to the initiation of using fNIRS in alcohol research.  \n \nIntroduction:  Heavy alcohol consumption patterns are related to evidence of altered prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity \nand potential impairment of higher -level neurocognitive functions (executive functions)  [1]. While traditional \nneuroimaging methods such as fMRI have been used to investigate alcohol -related changes, the cost and accessibility \nof fMRI can make it prohibitive. The current study aims to test the utility of fNIRS in detecting changes in PFC \nhaemodynamics across social drinking levels during executive function performance.  \n \nMethods: Thirty -nine non -dependent, social drinkers (mean age 24.74 (± 7.75)) completed questionnaires assessing \nalcohol use, psychological wellbeing, and subjective  executive functioning. LUMO, a high -density fNIRS system, \nmeasured cortical haemodynamics in the PFC bilaterally during completion of four tasks assessing executive function; \nGo/No -Go (GNG) , Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, Number -Letter, and N -Back.  Particip ants were categorised as light \nor hazardous level drinkers based on their reported alcohol consumption.  \n \nResults: No significant differences were found between \nthe light and hazardous drinking groups in their subjective \nappraisal of their executive functioning abilities  nor were \nthere any performance differences on any of the cognitive \ntasks.  Whilst analysis of the fNIRS data is ongoing, thus \nfar limited evidence has been  found for differences in PFC \nactivity during executive function performance  (Fig 1) . \n \nConclusion:  In line with previous research, this study did \nnot find executive functioning differences across levels of \nnon-clinical alcohol consumption. Typically, differences \nare observed at the neural level, with altered PFC \nactivation [2] which individuals may not be subjectively \naware of. Whilst limited evidence for differences in \nneurovascular activation  has been identified so far , future \nstudies with a larger sample size may better elucidate any \nchanges due to drinking patterns. Through establishing \nthe use of a non-invasive, portable neuroimaging tool such as fNIRS in alcohol research, there are implications on the \ncapabilities of future studies involving individuals with an alcohol use disorder.  \n \nReferences  \n1.

Preliminary data show localized activation in the fNIRS regions of interest  and \nexpected evoked response potential (ERP) markers in the EEG regions of interest. This work can \nprovide a more comprehensive functional and cognitive understanding of the auditory processing \nstream and become  the foundation for the developmen t of more complex assistive hearing devices.   \n \nIntroduction:  The cocktail party effect refers to the ability to \nisolate and attend to a specific stimulus, despite the presence \nof conflicting stimuli . The difficulty or inability to do this is \ncalled the cocktail party problem, which  affects \nneurodivergent individuals  and those who are hearing \nimpaired. Current assistive hearing devices neglect the \ncontribution of outside stimuli in speech processing , making \nit difficult to only process a specific  sound. Combined fNIRS -\nEEG can contribute to the  investigation of auditory \nprocessing and the  determination of brain regions involved in \nthe cocktail party effec t. We believe that fNIRS data can be \nused to decode attended locations and EEG  data can be used \nto track the attended audio stream, which can provide the \nfoundation for the  develop ment  tools that can better assist \nindividuals with sound isolation and processing.   \nMethods:  Three  subjects sat head -fixed  and focused on  a \ncross on the screen , while wearing noise cancellation \nearphones and a whole head adjustable fNIRS -EEG cap, with  \n9 custom built dual wavelength  source optodes  (NIRx \nMedical Technologies, Germany),  that were co -located with \n9 LiveAmp active wet electrodes (BrainProducts, Germany) . \nIn the cocktail party simulation, subjects  were cued with 2 \nsecond s of white noise  to indicate the  audio stream of \nimportance (left vs right). Then, two different 3 second audio  \nclips played into the left and right ears. The subject was then \nprompted to answer, via button press, what the  target  speaker was saying .  \nResults and Conclusion : The results show localized hemodynamic responses  in various regions of interest , such as \nthe frontal eye field, primary sensory, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus regions  (Fig. 1) , as well as expected \nEEG auditory responses  in the fronto -central, central, and centr o-parietal regions . Additionally, various hemodynamic \nshapes and evoked responses from other regions were observed and require further investigation.  The promising \npreliminary results will allow us to further investigate the complexities of auditory processing .

    "Classificationof first-episodepsychosis patients using brain\nactivityand behavioralresponse during livefaceprocessing\nRSingh*,DBhaskar,XZhang,ANoah,CTek,VSrihari,SKrishnaswamy,JHirsch\nWu Tsai Institute, Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University\nr.singh@yale.edu\nAbstract: We present a deep learning method for classifying first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients\nfrom neural and behavioral recordings during a novel live face-to-face interaction paradigm. We\nemploy recurrent encoder-decoder networks to learn (joint) low-dimensional representations of\nmultimodal brain imaging and behavioral data, e.g. fNIRS, EEG, and facial expressions. We show\nthat these learned representations classify FEP patients and predict specific GAF role scores\n(measure of functioning).\nIntroduction: The neural mechanisms of live face processing have been a fundamental research area in cognitive\nneuroscience and psychiatry, in part due to clinical applications relating to schizophrenia and autism [1,2]. Most of the\nexisting analysis of FEP patient data either focuses on resting-state neural recordings [3] or univariate methods such as\nGLM. In contrast, we take a neural network-based multivariate approach to analyze data from multiple modalities\nincluding functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalography (EEG), and facial expressions\nduring live face processing. Our experimental design for data collection is motivated by the “live interactive\nneuroscience” approach [1]. We employ a deep recurrent encoder-decoder framework to learn compressed and\ninformative latent representations of multiple modalities. These representations reveal a highly structured and\ntemporally organized trajectory in 3-D, with high-curvature segments corresponding to transitions in brain activity\nbetween tasks and rest. Moreover, the latent trajectories are utilized for distinguishing between FEP patients and\ntypically developed (TD) individuals, as well as for forecasting clinical scores (using the global assessment of\nfunctioning (GAF) scale) that indicate the severity of psychosis.\nMethods: Our study is based on 19 TD individuals and 14 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Functional\nbrain responses are acquired with Shimadzu LABNIRS (134 channels) and EEG (32 channels) along with facial\nexpression recordings. The action units\n(AU) of facial expressions were computed\nusing OpenFace [4]. Using an experimental\nsetup with the subject watching an actor's\nface, we record 24 blocks (each of 30\nseconds) of brain activity where the actor is\nstimulated by different emotionally\nvalenced videos. The encoder and decoder\nframework consists of multiple long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) layers to learn\nlatent representations from multiple\nmodalities including fNIRS, EEG, and\nfacial expressions. These representations are\nfurther fed to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification in trials and subjects withheld during training. We\nutilize a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, tPHATE [5], to visualize the learned embeddings in 3-D.\nResults: The classification accuracy achieved using fNIRS data on withheld subject blocks is determined to be 85%,\noutperforming traditional support vector machine (SVM) accuracy of 71% and stand-alone MLP accuracy of 67%.\nIncorporating joint representations from fNIRS and EEG/facial expression data enhances accuracy to 88%. The\ncorrelation coefficient between predicted scores and true GAF role scores is computed at 0.4789. Additionally,\nvisualizing the learned embeddings in 3-D space using tPHATE enables the identification of task switching times.\nConclusion: We achieve higher classification accuracy from multimodal (fNIRS and EEG/AU) joint representation\nlearning than achieved solely from fNIRS data validating the usefulness of multimodal data processing. Our ongoing\nefforts involve gathering more data to improve generalization across subjects, with a primary emphasis on\nunderstanding FEP through neural recordings stimulated by live face processing.\n[1] Hirsch et al. “Neural correlates of eye contact and social function in ASD\" Plos One, 2022.\n[2] Zhang et al. “SVM prediction of ADOS scores based on live eye-to-eye contact” Scientific Reports , 2024.\n[3] de Miras et al. “Schizophrenia classification from resting state EEG” Biomed Sig Processing and Control , 2023.\n[4] Tadas et al. “Openface 2.0.” IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition . 2018.\n[5] Busch et al. “Multi-view manifold learning for brain-state trajectories” Nature Computational Science , 2023.\n309 of 398",
    "Developing an Inclusive Approach to fNIRS Measurement in \nMinority Study Participants \n \nL. Pollonini1*, S.L. Gorniak* \n \n*Equal Contribution, 1University of Houston, TX, USA  \nPresenting Author email address: lpollonini@uh.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Our lab has been working to develop a more inclusive approach to fNIRS measurement \nin individuals  who are typically excluded from fNIRS studies —specifically women of color.  We \npresent our approach as well as future work in this area to improve recruitment and retention of \nwomen and persons of color in fNIRS studies.  \n \nIntroduction:  Poor signal -to-noise  ratio (SNR ) has been cited as a significant barrier to fNIRS research when study \nparticipants have dense  hair or large amounts of hair . Most frequently, this problem  occurs in data collected from \npersons of color , with women of color being the most negatively impacted by this problem  because of their typically \nlarge r amount of hair and/or hairstyle of choice . Consequently , these individuals may not be deemed as good \ncandidates for fNIRS studies  and are therefore excluded  often. As a result , fNIRS research conducted  to: (1) better \nunderstand how the brain works, and (2) detect, diagnose, and treat many neurological and mental health  conditions \nis based primarily on data collected from men.  Consequently , women and persons of color will be  disproportionally \nimpacted when fNIRS technologies transition to regular clinical use for diagnostic purposes , and diagnostic measures \ncaptured from their fNIRS data may not meet the male -centric diagnostic and treatment criteria developed from \nresearch. To counteract this, our group has been working to develop strategies to be more inclusive in fNIRS \nresearch —specifically in women of color .  \n \nMethods:  Inclusive approaches to fNIRS involve a combination of changes to researcher behaviors in pre -fNIRS \nassessments and during fNIRS assessments.  Prior  to fNIRS assessments,  our lab has taken the following steps to \nprepare a more inclusive approach to fNIRS data collection: (1) active recruitment of women and persons of color, (2) \nintegration of questions regarding hair type and skin tone into self -report questionnaires , (3) development of an fNIRS \ncap that has shown improved SNR  data across diverse self -reported hair types, (4) explain ing to potential participants  \nhow fNIRS data will be collected using pictures  with the actual device, (5) discussion and explanation of how \nparticipants will not be able to wear wigs or hair extensions during testing, (6) scheduling fNIRS data collections to \naccommodate hair appointments as needed (e.g., professional removal of sewn -in extensions) , and (7) flexibility in \ndate and time of fNIRS sessions to accommodate work schedules  as well as childcare and eldercare responsibilities.  \nDuring fNIRS sessions,  our lab has taken the following steps: (1) inquir ing about fNIRS cap comfort  multiple times \nthroughout testing , (2) using an internally illuminated crochet hook or ear curette to gently move hair/braids/locs away \nfrom optodes and detectors, and (3) provide shower opportunities for participants to wash their hair if they wish to do \nso after testing ses sions.  \n \nResults: To date, we have had significant success in recruiting and retaining women, particularly women of color, in \nour fNIRS studies due to the inclusive approach described above.  Our current study focusing on fNIRS imaging in \nwomen of color has retained all 20 participants who were initially recruited for the study. Our data has also shown \nimproved SNR  data in our sample as compared to prior studies in our lab which included women of color.  \n \nConclusion:  Our approach to inclusivity in fNIRS research has resulted in improved recruitment and retention of \nwomen on color in our studies along with improved SNR  data.  Future work in this area will include development of \nmathematical models to incorporate hair type, skin tone, age1, adiposity measures1, and sex1 in additional improvement \nof S:R measurements  during data post -processing .  \n \n \nReferences:  \n1.

There is a lack of  comparison studies between  SCOS  and \nDCS at longer (i.e. >20 mm) source -detector separations (SDS ’s) that afford sufficient sensitivity \nto the adult human brain. We validated SCOS b lood flow index (BFi) values against DCS  at longer \nSDS’s and found SCOS contrast -to-noise ratio (CNR) to be >10x higher than DCS in phantom s. \nResults from concurrent SCOS and DCS human CBF measurements will also be presented.  \n \nIntroduction:  Concurrent SCOS and DCS human measurements have previously been performed at relatively short \n(i.e. ≤20 mm) SDS’s1-2. At longer SDS’s  that are relevant to human CBF measurements, photon flux becomes low \nand both camera noise and nonidealities can significantly impact SCOS accurac y. Careful  camera  selection and \ncharacterization, as well as correction of the measured speckle contrast, become necessary to derive valid BFi values \nfrom SCOS. We have previously developed camera selection , system optimization,  and noise correction procedures \nfor SCOS3, which we aim to validate through concurrent SCOS and  DCS measurements in phantoms and humans . \nMethods:  Noise -corrected SCOS rBFi was validated against  DCS rBFi in a phantom temperature titration experiment, \nwhere a tissue -mimicking liquid phantom ( ȝa = 0.1 cm-1, ȝs’ = 9.4 cm-1, Ȝ = 852 nm ) was heated from 3 °C to 25 °C. \nWe used a DCS channel at 25 mm SDS and a SCOS channel at 30 mm SDS.  The CNR comparison was done using \nconcurrent SCOS and DCS measurements on a tube -based flow phantom, where a flow velocity of 2 cm/s  was \nperiodically induced in a 2 mm diameter tube submerged in the liquid phantom. We defined CNR as the percentage \nchange in BFi divided by the coefficient of variation  in BFi . We varied the co -localized SCOS and DCS SDS between \n25 mm and 40 mm, and varied the distance between the SCOS/DCS probe and the tube from  6 mm to 22 mm to \nsimulate different extracerebral tissue thicknesses .

    "Sleep EEG slow waves, sleep spindles and fNIRS functional \nconnectivity in napping infants  \nLouisa K. Gossé, Paola Pinti, Clare E. Elwell, Emily J. H. Jones \n \n aBirkbeck, University of London, Faculty  of Psychological Sciences, London, UK ; bUniversity College London , Department of Medical Physics \nand Biomedical Engineering, London, UK     l.gosse@bbk.ac.uk   \n \nAbstract: Developmental slee p markers such as EEG slow waves  and sleep spindles  could be the mechanism  by \nwhich functional connectivity, sleep and development  are linked . We used wearable fNIRS -EEG in napping  infants \nand measured fNIRS functional connectivity patterns and EEG slow wave  and spindle  characteristics. Slow waves \nand spindles could indeed modulate functional connectivity showing a cascading impact on development.  \n \nIntroduction:  Sleep facilitate s learning  both via s o -called slo w waves  (high amplitude oscillations <4.5Hz) and \nspindles  (fast oscillations of 11 -16Hz  lasting x seconds)  that are measured using electroencephalography (EEG).  Slow \nwaves appear to also foster functional connectivity  (FC) in adults  (1). In infants this link has yet to be investigated  \nand the assoc iation of sleep spindles wit h FC is unclear . FC predicts later cognitive development in infants ( 3) and \ninfants with more and/or higher amplitude sleep slow waves are better at learning new informati on (2). In this study \nwe examine how  EEG -measured  sleep slow waves  and spindles  co-modulate with fNIRS -measured functional \nconnectivity  during a nap  in infants as measured by wearable simultaneous NIRS -EEG.  \n \nMethods:  5-to-9-months -old infants  (N=34) participated  napped at the  Birkbeck ToddlerLab  NapLab , University of \nLondon, London, UK. A customized  wearable NIRS -EEG headgear integrating a 2 0-channel EEG system (Enobio, \nNeuroelectrics , ES) and 47-channel NIRS  system  (BabyBrite , Artinis,  NL) was used. Data quality checks/pre -\nprocessing/analyses were performed using Matlab 2022 b (QT-NIRS  for fNIRS , custom scripts  for fNIRS/EE G, \nFieldtrip  for EEG).  fNIRS data was segmented into 120 -second  epochs and channel -by-channel correlational analyses \nwere performed to obtain epoch -by-epoch connectivity matrices.  Average power in slow wave (0.5 -4Hz)/sleep spindle \n(11-16Hz) bands was extracted  for each epoch . EEG characteristics per epoch were then linked to fNIRS FC  (see \nGossé et al., 202 3 for example , 4) for each individual  participant . Preliminary single  subject results show differences \nin connectivity depending on nap length and length of slow wave periods. Further analyses will include group  analyses \nof common connectivity patterns (using  cluster analysis)  and alternative FC analyses (i.e., dynamic functional \nconnectivity ) and their  assoc iations of with \nsleep EEG characteristics.  Figure 1 shows \nan e xample of single subject fNIRS \ncorrelational matrices and the corresponding \nslow wave and spindle band power analyses.  \n \nConclusion : Results show preliminary \nevidence that studying  sleep  spindle s and \nslow wave s and their co -modu lation with \nFC during a nap could provide information \non how sleep cascades onto  development . In \nthe long run this study has implications for \nsleep interventions as e.g., slow waves can \nbe modulated by auditory stimulatio n to \nprolong deep sleep .  \n  \n \nFunding:  EU-HORIZON2020 Grant  \nNo.721859 (UK) |ISSF2 Wellcome Trust \npostdoctoral fellowship Grant  \nNo.204770/Z/16/Z).   \nReferences : (1) Aedo -Jury et al., 2020, \nElife.

    "Evaluation of a high framerate FD -fNIRS system for \nAuditory -Inspired Speech Envelope Extraction  \n \nBiao Zheng1, Hyojin Park2,3 and Hamid Dehghani1,3 \n \n1School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK   \n2School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK  \n3Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH), University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK  \nbxz056@student.bham.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Block averaging is often utilized to compute the averaged hemodynamic response elicited \nby repetitive tasks within the experimental paradigm. In auditory cortex studies, it is desirable to \ncollect data at a high framerate >10Hz, with no block averaging to allow calculation and analysis  of \nthe auditory  signal,  which can lead to a better understanding of brain development and function . \nThis work demonstrate s that there may be a good contrast in the data, collected at ~40Hz to allow \ndata analysis for Auditory -Inspired Speech Envelope Extraction . \n \nIntroduction:  This work  considers the application of fNIRS to auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm, where \nthe goal is to determine which of two simultaneous speakers a person is attending to. The paradigm relies on recordings \nof the listener's brain activity, using NIRS . To perform AAD, decoded NIRS  signals will require  correlat ion with the \ntemporal envelopes of the speech signals of the separate speakers.  To allow this, a high framerate data acquisition is \nrequired , ideally  without the need to block average the data (i.e. multiple repeats) to extract the clini cally useful \ninformation. In this study we evaluate the recovered signal contrast to a simple auditory stimuli to evaluate the signal \nquality as acquired at ~40Hz.  \nMethods: Initially, there is a 20 -second reference period at the commencement and conclusion of the experiment , Fig \n1. Subsequently, the participant wears headphones and listens to a 10 -second TikTok audio clip. Following this \nstimulation, a resting stage ensues, at 15 seconds. This is repeat ed 5 times [1]. The experiment is managed by a laptop, \nwhich automatically plays the audio and transmits signals to the LabJack device  to allow synchronization with the \nNIRS system . The LabJack device adds markers to th e ISS frequency domain fNIRS system  which acquires the data \nat ~40Hz . The Source/Detectors were placed over the left and right auditory cortex at 30 mm separation , Fig 2.    Figure 1:  The protocol of the experiment  Figure 2:  Data acquisition \nfrom a subject  Figure 3: Maximum signal intensity at a \nwavelength for different block averages  Results: The data presented in Figure 3 indicate that a single event yields the lowest signal change due to the measured \nauditory AC signal.  Subsequent to an increase in the number of events, the recovered contrast due to the stimuli  exhibit \nan upward trend. These findings highlight the possibility of a continuous monitoring of the cortical response to \nauditory stimuli, at 40Hz to allow analysis of the temporal envelopes of the speech , which we will present.  \nConclusion:  The superimposition of data from multiple tasks amplifies the block -averaged data, consequently \nelevating the concentrations of oxy -hemoglobin and deoxy -hemoglobin. The selection of block -averaged data \nsignificantly influences the outcome, given the variab ility in brain responses to stimuli. Increasing the number of block \naverages enhances the accuracy of the results. Additionally, as demonstrated in this paper [2], the Blood Oxygen Level \nDependent (BOLD) response to identical tasks diminishes c onsiderably. Thus, careful control over the repetition of \nevents and tasks becomes imperative.  \nReferences: [1] Lawrence, R.J. et al.

Our experiment involves ecologically\nvalid \"cocktail party\" scenarios where participants focus on audiovisual stimuli in both overt and covert contexts.\nThis approach allows analysis of cortical activity patterns and decoding of attended spatial locations, with potential\napplications in enhancing brain-computer interface technologies for hearing aids. This method addresses the\nlimitations of fMRI and EEG by enabling more natural human subject behavior and improved spatial resolution.\nIntroduction: Complex Scene Analysis (CSA) enables the brain to focus on a single auditory or visual object in\ncrowded environments. While this occurs effortlessly in a healthy brain, many hearing-impaired individuals and\nthose with neurodivergent conditions such as ADHD and autism experience difficulty in CSA, impacting speech\nintelligibility (Dunlop et al., 2016). Whole head brain imaging during active CSA has potential to reveal critical\ninsights into underlying cortical activity patterns. Although electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) are common in brain imaging, their limitations have restricted ecologically valid CSA\nstudies. Motion constraints and persistent background noise during scanning makes fMRI a less ecologically valid\nmodality for CSA. EEG, while beneficial for its high temporal resolution, poses limitations due to its comparatively\nlower spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose employing a whole head HD fNIRS system for\nCSA in naturalistic settings.\nMethods: Our experimental design replicates an ecologically valid cocktail party scenario in both overt and covert\ncontexts. In the overt scenario, 3-second audiovisual movie clips are presented simultaneously at 30 degrees to the\nleft and right. Prior to each clip, a 2-second spatialized\nwhite noise cue is paired with a white crosshair on the\ncorresponding screen, guiding subjects on which\ndirection to focus, with eye movements allowed. In\nthe covert scenario, subjects are exposed solely to\nspatialized audio from the same set of movies. Here,\nthe 2-second spatialized white noise serves as the cue,\ndirecting their attention, while they maintain a gaze on\na central screen displaying a static white crosshair.\nfNIRS data were collected from 3 subjects using the\nNinjaNIRS22 system with a whole head, high density\ncap. We aim to analyze whole-brain evoked responses\nto understand cortical activity patterns in both\nscenarios. Moreover, our goal extends to decoding\nspatial location information, which holds potential for\nbrain-computer interface applications, such as\nenhancing hearing aid algorithms to selectively focus on specific sound sources (Ning et al., 2024).\nResults: Our preliminary group results (Figure 1) show that we are able to see evoked responses in frontal eye fields\n(FEF), primary auditory regions, superior and medial temporal gyrus, primary sensory regions, supramarginal gyrus,\nand angular gyrus in both overt and covert conditions. In addition, we see that the evoked responses in eye\nonly/control conditions do not show similar evoked response signatures in the regions.\nReferences\nDunlop, W. A., Enticott, P. G., & Rajan, R.

    "Impact of Cognitive Load Domains on Neural Activation  \nDuring Laparoscopic  Appendicectomy  Procedure  \n \nVirginia Caddick 1, Miranda Ramirez3, Aws Almukhtar 1, Ara Darzi1, Felipe Orihuela -\nEspina 2*, Daniel R Leff 1,* \n \n1 Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, UK. ; 2 Department of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, \nBirmingham, UK. ; 3National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics  ( INAOE  ), Mexico ; *Joint senior author  \nPresenting Author email address: v.caddick@imperial.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract: High cognitive workload (CWL) states, particularly extraneous, account for 87.1% of \nmedical errors.  10 surgical trainees carried out 5 simulated laparoscopic appendicectomies , \ninvolving a benchmarking procedure and a 2x2 trial design to investigate the effects of intrinsic load \n(intra -operative bleeding) and extraneous load (auditory distractions) upon prefrontal cortical \nactivation, perceived workload,  and technical performance. A main effect of extraneous load (i.e. \nintraoperative auditory and team distractions) upon  perceived workload  and technical performance \n(task completion times and specimen dissection)  was demonstrated . fNIRS data analysis is ongoing.  \nIntra -operative events increase perceived workload, stress, distraction and technical performance.  \n \nIntroduction : CWL can be defined as “the cognitive and psychological effort that is required from a subject to \ncomplete a given task”1. fNIRS has become a well -established non -invasive , increasingly wearable , objective CWL \nassessment tool, utilising  a near -infrared -range to measure the concentration changes of oxygenated haemoglobin \n(HbO 2) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb)). Post Covid -19 pandemic, with clinician burden higher than ever, \nrecognising contributing factors to cognitive overload could reduce surgical errors and enhance patient safety.  This \nstudy explores how independent CWL domains affect perceived and objective CWL , and technical performance.  \n \nMethods: 10 surgical trainees (CT1 -CT3) perfo rmed laparoscopic appendicectomies using an augmented -reality \nsimulator (INOVUS LapAR, UK). A baseline benchmarking procedure was followed by a 2x2 block design, \nindependently assessing the effects of: (i) intrinsic load (low vs high); and (ii) extraneous load (low vs high conditions). \nA NIRSports2 fNIRS device (NIRx, wavelengths 760nm and 850nm), with a 61 channel optode array situated over \nthe prefrontal cortices (PFC), primary motor cortices and supplementary motor areas measured fluctuations in \noxygenated and deoxygenate d haemoglobin  concentrations. Outcome measures included: fNIRS cortical activation \npatterns, perceived workload (SURG -TLX), and objective performance metrics (task completion times (TCTs), and \nspecimen/stump measurements). fNIRS data was reconstructed with MBLL, DPF (6 .25). The processing pipeline \nincluded decimation, detrending, optode movement detection, removal of systemics, and quality control efforts2. \n \nResults: The mean (StD) age was 29.6 (+/ -2.41)  years  and 40% were female. A main effect of extraneous load was \ndemonstrated  for perceived  workload  with two -way ANOVA analysis: total SURG -TLX scores (F(1,45)=27.291, \np<0.001), situational stress (F(1,45)=17.058, p<0.001) and distraction (F(1,45)=12.413, p<0.001 ) increased . \nConversely, perceived physical demand (F(1,45)=4.079, p=0.049) and task complexity (F(1,45)=10.712, p=0.002) \ndecreased. Technical performance deteriorated with extraneous load: m ean stump length (F( 1,45)=5.679, p=0.022) \nand stump:specimen ratio (F(1,45)=4.316, p=0.044) increased whilst  appendix specimen length  decreased \n(F(1,45)=4.658, p=0.036). TCTs increased with high intrinsic load (F(1,45)=10.325, p<0.001). Optical neuroimaging \ndata analysis  (i event labelling and time course analysis ) is currently ongoing . Further results will be presented at the \nfNIRS UK conference.   \n \nConclusion:  High load conditions increase perceived total workload, stress, distraction and are associated with \nperformance decline both in terms of extent of surgical resection and TCTs. High intrinsic workload increases \noperative time. Contributors to extraneous workload such as bleeps, loud anaesthetic monitors, and team interruptions \nincrease workload to a great er extent, and may lead to surgical errors.  \n \nReferences:  \n1.

Eye-tracking  and fNIRS signals were recorded  during \nnatural face -gaze at either live or video faces. TD participants , compared to ASD participants,  \nexhibited  reduced power  in eye movements  during gaze at Real Eyes compared to Video Eyes. \nFurther, a 6 Hz saccade frequency component  applied as a continuous regressor revealed greater TD \nactivity  in rSMG  and D LPFC . Findings suggest that a SMG -DLPFC  complex  is more active for TD \nthan ASD participants during visual sensing of live faces.  \n \nIntroduction:  Previous studies have identified distinct eye -contact patterns in individuals diagnosed with autism \nspectrum disorder (ASD) compared to typically developed individuals (TD ) [1, 2]. However, the neural correlates of \nthese differences are not known.  We address this knowledge gap with eye-tracking data  and fNIRS  data acquired \nsimultaneously during face gaze conditions .  The neural correlates of continuous eye movement s during face gaze \nwere identified using a method of continuous regression and findings were  compared for TD and ASD.  \n \nMethods: Our study analyzed the data from 7 ASD and 7 TD adults from a previous fNIRS study  [3] using the \nShimadzu  LABNIRS with 54 channels per person  for fNIRS data and two Tobii Pro x3 -120 for eye -tracking data , Fig \n1a. Participants were instructed to gaze either at a partner's eyes (Real Eye) or the eyes in a video (Video Eye) in 3 -\nsecond ‘eye-on’ epochs  (red in Fig 1a), followed by 3 -sec ‘eye-off’ epochs. This pattern of 3 -sec eye-on and 3-sec \neye-off epochs constituted a n 18- sec task block , alternating with 1 2-sec rest blocks . Matlab function  cwt was applied \nto decompose the time -frequency information of \nthe gaze point data along the x -axis. The power \nof gaze data at 6 Hz as applied as a  modulator \n(covariate) of neural activity on fNIRS signals  \nbecause this frequency is a dominant frequency \nfor saccades . \n \nResults: Eye-movement power  was reduced in \nthe Real-Eye condition compared to the Video -\nEye condition for TD participants  (Fig 1b , left ) \nsuggesting more stable control of eye -\nmovements during face gaze .  However, th is \neye-movement power did not differ between \nconditions for ASD participants  (Fig 1b, right) . \nApplication the eye-movement power at 6 Hz as \na modulator of neural signals revealed higher \nactivity during the Real -Eye condition  in the right supramarginal gyrus, SMG , compared to the Video -Eye condition  \nfor TD  (Fig 1c, left)  but not  for ASD (Fig 1c , middle ) with greater TD activity in right rDLPFC (Fig 1c , right panel) . \n \nConclusion:  The neural correlates for eye -movements  during  live face  gaze include right hemisphere SMG and \nDLPFC. This previously unreported complex is more active in TD than in ASD  and implicates a role for visual sensing \nmechanisms as a component of  face processing difficulties in ASD.  \n \n[1] Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of  Mental Disorders (DSM -5®). 2013  \n[2] Senju  et al. \"Atypical eye contact in autism: models, mechanisms and development.\" Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews , 2009  \n[3] Hirsch et al. “Neural correlates of eye contact and social function in autism spectrum disorder” PLoS One , 2022   \n316 of 398",

Adam Noah, Xian Zhang, Cenk Tek, Vinod Srihari, Joy Hirsch  \n \nYale School of Medicine   \nadam@adamnoah.com  \n \nAbstract:  The neural mechanisms underlying symptoms in early psychosis are not well understood. \nWe test the hypothesis that typical and early psychosis patients will differ in the neural responses to \nlive face gaze. N eural activity utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS) was measured \nfrom  14 first episode  psychosis  (FEP)  patients and 20 typical (TD) individuals participating in a \ndyadic face -to-face interaction. fNIRS results showed a significant ly higher responses  in the left \nsupramarginal gyrus  (SMG) compared to TD individuals  who showed similar changes in the right \nhemisphere.   This difference  in neural processing  may indicate underlying mechanistic differences \nthat can be utilized for diagnostic purposes.  \n \nIntroduction:  Face reading is a foundational feature of social interactions . We test the  hypothesis that underlying \nmechanisms differ between typical and early psychosis patients.  We have previously utilized  live dyadic paradigm s \nin typically developing individuals and found that the ability to process facial expression is related to activity in the \nright angular and supramarginal gyri in the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) of the superficial cortex1. Here w e test the \nhypothesis that variations in  live facial  observation  will differ for early psychosis patients  during live face -to-face \ninteraction . \n \nMethods: Participants consisted of 20 age -matched, typically developing individuals and 1 4 FEP patients recruited \nfrom the Y ale STEP clinic. These participants interacted with a trained confederate partner in a 20-minute  face-to-\nface social interaction. During the interaction multiple recordings were obtained from participants including 134 \nchannels of fNIRS  using a Shimadzu LABNIRS. A custom python program was developed to control the social \nenvironment in which a smart -glass was manipulated to transition between opaque and transparent states to modulate \nwhen and if TD and FEP patients could view the face of their confederate partner.  The confederate partner was cued \nwith multiple types of short emotionally provocative videos (bo th positive and negative valance) to naturally \nmanipulate facial expression .  In one condition partners made direct face gaze and in the other, gaze was diverted.  \nfNIRS data were analyzed using a modified version of NIRS -SPM in MATLAB  as well as  other custom MATLAB  \nscripts.  \n \nResults: GLM analysis of fNIRS recordings show increased activity for FEP patients localized in the left \nsupramarginal gyrus  compared to TD counterparts  for direct versus diverted eye contact .  \n \nConclusion:  Increased neural activity was found in the language reception area during live (but non -verbal) face -to-\nface interaction  with direct eye -contact  in patients which may serve as a biomarker to aid in diagnosis of individuals \nat risk for psychosis.  \n \nReferences \n1Hirsch , J., Zhang, X., Noah, J.

However, most studies have focused on upper limb stimulation . In this \nstudy , we utilized  fNIRS to observe cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin changes in 16 healthy \nparticipants undergoing painful/non -painful electrical stimulation of bilateral groin s and knee s. \nResults reveal ed prefrontal cortex deactivation during painful stimulation, notably left groin. \nVarying lower limb stimulation yields distinct activation patterns in primary somatosensory cortex, \nproviding evidence for cortical pain processing and fNIRS feasibility in studying pain mechanisms \nacross lower limb regions.  \n \nIntroduction:  Acute pain can be induced by various stimuli  and neuroimaging can aid in unraveling the central \nnervous system factors related to pain perception1. However, most studies have focused on upper limb stimulation, \nwith limited investigation into lower limbs2. In this study, we utilized fNIRS to observe brain changes in \noxyhemoglobin levels during both painful and non -painful electrical stimulation of various lower limb sites . \nAdditionally,  explored perceptual responses to different levels of electrical stimulation across these lower limb sites.  \n \nMethods:  Sixteen healthy participants  (24 ±  3.4 years ) were subjected to both painful and non-painful  electrical \nstimulation on the bilateral groin and knee regions, respectively. A 49 -channel f NIRS device was utilized to monitor \nalterations in oxyhemoglobin concentration within the prefrontal cortex and primary somatosensory cortex regions \nunder varying stimulation conditions. Stimulation intensity was evaluated using a visual analog scale.  \n \nResults: Our findings revealed that stimulation intensity was notably lower for bilateral knees compared to the left \ngroin. Deactivation of the prefrontal cortex was observed during painful stimulation, particularly when stimulating \nthe left groin, compared to non -painful stimulation. However, regarding results from the primary somatosensory \ncortex, divergent activation patterns were observed when different lower limb sites were subjected to  varying degrees \nof stimulation  (See the figure) .  \n \nConclusion:  These findings provide evidence for the processing of pain on a cortical level and underscore the \nfeasibility  of utilizing fNIRS to investigate pain mechanisms related to stimulation across distinct lower limb regions.                              \n \nReferences :  \n1.Espinoza, S. , et al.

Five \nhealthy young adults performed a motor task in both sitting and standing conditions reve aling: i) a \ncommon variation of physiological spectral components derived from fNIRS data; ii) an \nimprovement in estimating non -significant cortical areas with respect to task conditions. Overall, \nthese preliminary results suggest the importance of characterizing posture interference with fNIRS \nwhen considering the progress towards fNIRS monitoring in freely moving environment .  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy  (fNIRS) is gaining relevance as ecological monitoring tool. \nHowever, moving towards the monitoring of brain activity in real -life conditions requires accounting for more \ncomplex interactions  between fNIRS signals and physiological confounding factors  (von Lühmann  et al., 2021 ) \nincluding  posture changes, affecting both cortical oxygenation  (Mol et al., 2022 ) and cardiovascular regulation  (Porta \net al., 2022) . This work  addresses the effects of posture changes on a well-established motor task and proposes a novel \nmethod to account them in fNIRS statistical analysis .   \nMethods: Five right -handed healthy young adult participants  (mean age (SD)  27.4 (4.6) years , all males) performed \na block -design left - and right -hand grasping task.

The task \nwas repeated both in sitting and standing positions and randomized across subjects.  Moreover, as benchmark we \nsimulated a known hemodynamic response over 5 -minutes sitting and standing resting -state conditions following the \ntiming of the task. The proposed \nmethod for accounting posture \nchanges considers as additi onal \nGLM regressors the ratio between \nlow frequency oscillations (LFO: \n0.04 – 0.15 Hz) vs. cardiac \npulsation (0.8 – 1.5 Hz) signals \nderived from SSC. Subject -level \nstatistical activation maps are \nfinally compared with/without \nadditional LFO/cardiac  regressors \nand ROI -averaged over left  (L) and \nright  (R) precentral (Gpre) and \npostcentral (Gpost) gyri  (Bonilauri \net al., 2023) . \nResults: Overall, we observe  on \nboth tasks and simulations over \nresting -state conditions: i) a \nvariation in PSD% components in \nLFO vs. cardiac bandwidths across \nROIs, Δ[𝐻𝑏𝑂2] and  Δ[𝐻𝑏𝑅] signals (Figure 1), hence supporting LFO/cardiac signal ratio as additional GLM \nregressors; ii) the LFO/cardiac regressor implied a  reduction  from 10% to 30% of false positives in  the ipsilateral \nhemisphere with respect to the hand performing the task  (Figure 2).  \nConclusion:  These preliminary results suggest that posture changes have a major impact on the estimation of brain \nactivity and that the spectral content of fNIRS data can represent a viable indicator of these changes.  Therefore, \nmoving towards the monitoring of brain activity  in real -life condition s requires an appropriate characterization of \nphysiological components from fNIRS data. We are currently acquiring more participants to corroborate these results \nat group -level statistical analyses and on additional experimental paradigms.   \nAcknowledgements : Funded by  NRRP ( PNC0000003  - ANTHEM).   \nFigure 1: Variation of power spectral density percentage (PSD%) \ncomponents regarding Δ[𝐻𝑏𝑂2]-SSC measurements when performing the \ntask in sitting vs. standing  conditions.  \n \nFigure 2: Subject -level statistical activation maps related to right -hand \ngrasping in sitting and standing conditions without (l eft panel ) and with \n(right panel ) additional LFO/cardiac regressors during GLM analysis.  \n319 of 398",
    "Exploring the Relation  Between Surgeon Gentleness and \nHemodynamic Activity: A VR-fNIRS Study  \n \nSebahat Selin Sahin1, Doga Demirel2 Hasan Onur Keles1,3,4 \n \n1Biomedical Engineering, Ankara University, Turkey  \n2Computer Science , Florida Polytechnic University , USA \n3Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Center of Excellence (NgROM), Turkey  \n4Brain Research Center (AhBAUM), Ankara University, Turkey.  \n \nPresenting Author email address:  \nhokeles @ankara.edu.tr  \n \nAbstract:  In this study, we combined fNIRS and VR headset  to record participants’ hemodynamics \nwhen they are performing gentleness task  in immersive VR environment.  We propose to use fNIRS  \nto discover patterns of hemodynamic  activity  and behavioral /performance  variables that best \ndescribe  gentleness of s urgeons in the  virtual reality environment , discriminate levels of \nexpertise /gentleness . We de termined the feasibility  of using  fNIRS -VR to discriminate levels of \nexpertise /gentleness  in the vir tual r eality environment .  \n \nIntroduction:   \nSurgical outcome is strongly affected  by surgical skill, with gentleness is a key factor in determining proficiency in \nsurgery . Virtual reality has the potential to assess surgeons' special skills, including their gentleness and ability to \nhandle tissue with respect1. As technological progress makes user -friendly wearable sensors available and accepted, \nthe assessment of skills wi ll increasingly incorporate physiological data streams2,3. Our approach focusses on \nhemodynamic activity as surgical skill is fundamentally based in the brain . There is no stu dy investigating  \nhemo dynamics and relation to gentleness  of surge ons. We aim to measure gent leness and surge on sk ill level  of \nsurgeons  using the combining fNIRS -VR in the virtual surgical  training environment.  \nMethods: We initiall y conducted experiments involving 6 healthy volunteer subjects, including both experienced \nsurgeons and novices (ongoing recruitment). The subjects had varying levels of experience in laparoscopy, ranging \nfrom experienced surgeons  to complete beginne rs with no prior laparoscopic experience. Each participant performed \nthe gentleness  task while wearing the fNIRS device  (Artinis BriteMKIII , Holla nd) throughout the entire experiment. \nDuring th e experi ment , brain activity was recorded at 75 Hz using an 18 -channel fNIRS system placed at the \nInternational 10 -20 electrode sites, covering the bilateral frontal and motor cortices.  For this experiment, we used a \nsimple VR environment in which surgeons  were instructed to transfer a soft balloon (tissue -like) from the right side of \nthe scene to the left  box using both hands, a task referred to as the double graspers manipulation task1. Performance \nmeasures including gentle ness score  (VR-based)  and error rate were collected, along with NASA -TLX ratings and \nfNIRS recordings.    \nResults: Our initial results showed that gentleness  score were  significantly \ndifferent  between surgeons an d novices  (*p < 0.05) . The gentleness score was \ncorrelated to subgroup of NASA -TLX including performance , effort and \nfrustra tion. Surgeons has the low est the to tal NASA -TLX scor e compared  to \nnovices. We obs erved the c ertain pattern  differences  of hemodynamics \nbetween surgeons and novices.   \n Conclusion:  Combining the VR -fNIRS approach holds promise for \nassessing both surgical skill and gentleness. This study represents an initial exploration of feasibility, and we will \nexpand participation to enhance the robustness of our findings.  \nReferences  \n1- Farmer J, Demirel D, Erol R, Ahmadi D, Halic T, Kockara S, Arikatla S, Sexton K W, & Ahmadi S (2020).

Time -resolved spectroscopy  \n(TRS)  overcomes the shortcoming s with added complexity and cost . We compared  CW-NIRS and \nTRS during cardiopulmonary bypass initiation period of  neonatal  cardiac surger y (n= 9). By \nanalyzing  late photons in TRS, we obtain a better estimation of the brain hemodynamics. CW -NIRS \nand TRS correlate well (R=0.94 -0.99) but with a poor conc ordance and a promi nent non -linear  \nrelationship.  \n \nIntroduction:  Clinical oximeters based on c ontinuous wave near infrared spectroscopy (CW -NIRS)  have limitations  \nsuch as  the inability of separating the scattering and absorption coefficients  and strong dependence on superficial \nphoton pathlength s. These eventually lead to inaccurate  calculation of the  concentrations of the hemoglobin forms , \npoor precision  and repea tability  [1]. Time-resolved near infrared spectroscopy  (TRS) can measure absorption and \nscattering coefficients  and separate shorter and longer pathlengths, hence improving quantification, precision and \nrepea tability [2]. The aim of  this study  is to compare  cerebral oxygenation (StO 2) measured by a widely utilized \nclinical cerebral oximeter  (INVOSTM 5100C, Medtronic, MN, USA) and  TRS during  the cardiopulmonary bypass  \n(CPB) initiation period  of neonatal cardiac surgery  where characteristic  changes in StO 2 have been reported  [3, 4]. \nMethods:  Two pediatric  probes of CW-NIRS were placed  bilaterally  on the forehead  and the TRS probe  (2.0 cm \nsource -detector separation)  was placed around  right  tempor al-pariet al-occipital  region .  To minimize the extracranial \ncontamination, late photons -1.5 ns after the injected laser pulse - were used in fitting of the absorption and scattering \ncoefficients . Absolute levels of oxy - and deoxy -haemoglobin w ere then  calculated . The s ame smoothing procedure \nwas applied to  the TRS to align  it with the output of CW-NIRS . \nResults: Nine  neonates were monitored up to date . Three were  not \nused in the analysis  due to  the lack of data  in the same hemisphere for \nboth devices  during the CPB initiation period . Pearson correlation \ncoefficient ranged from  0.94 to 0.99 for all  the patients , but  the \nconcordance correlation coefficient  ranged from  0.30 to 0.84.  A \nproportional bias was observed  the Bland -Altman plot  in general  and \nthe difference  between methods reached to  25 %.  \nConclusion: The two systems disagree to  a degree higher than \ndifferences due to probing different regions on the head . This \nmotivates further continued data acquisition  by both modalities to \nunderstand if there are any erroneous clinical interpretations due to the \nlimitations of CW -NIRS.   \nAcknowledgments:  EC (VASCOVID, TINYBRAINS, Prometeus , No \n101109111/HDEFONE), Fundació CELLEX Barcelona, Fundació Mir -Puig, Fundació La Marató TV3, LCF/BQ/DI23/11990075, Agencia Estatal \nde Investigación  (PHOTOMETABO, PID2019 -106481RB -C31/10.13039/501100011033), the “Severo Ochoa” Programme for Centres of \nExcellence in R&D (CEX2019 -000910 -S), MEDLUX/LUXMED.    \nReferences: [1] Shaaban -Ali M. et al.

    "Using fNIRS to understand the utility of brain stimulation for \noptimising cognitive performance. \nMelanie Burke * and Amy Miller  \nSchool of Psychology, University of Leeds , Leeds  LS2 9JT. UK  \n* presenting author: m.r.burke@leeds.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  Functional Near Infra -Red Spectroscopy  (fNIRS) provides a unique opportunity  for research investigating effects of \ntranscranial  magnetic stimulation  (TMS)  on cognitive performance . The aim of the current study was to identify links between \ncognitive performance and oxygenation levels  in respon se to brain stimulation  in young, m iddle and older adults . Participants  \nperform ed tasks before and after brain stimulation  placed on the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Results revealed  \ndifferen tial effects of brain  stimulation  between age groups , hemispheres,  and tasks , with improvements in working memo ry tasks \nafter left hemisphere stimulation related to  increase s in efficacy of neural activity  within and between hemispheres .  \nIntroduction:  Brain stimulation can provide cognitive benefit  in individuals when appl ied to the prefrontal cortex  in both \ncognitive ly “normal ” [Pino-Esteban et al., 2021 ] and those  with neurodegenerative  diseases such as Alzheimer’s  [Miller et al., 20 23]. \nDespite the potential utility of brai n stimulation  for cognitive  decline, little is kno wn about the local and distal  haemodynamic  effects  \nthis intervention has on the brain . The current study aims to address this gap in the literature, b y assessing  haemodynamic  changes \nin brain activity before and after brain stimulation to a range of cognitive  tasks in cognitively normal individuals  across the lifespan.    \nMethod: 45 participants  (15 young, 15  middle -aged, 15  older adults)  took part in this ethically approved study. Participants \nperformed 4 cognitive tasks before and after i ntermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) . The coil was  positioned on either the right \n(F4/D1) or left (F3/D 3) dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex (DLPFC)  in two independent testing sessions  a week apart.  Accuracy and \nreaction time was recorded using an eye -tracker (EyeLink 1000Hz , SR Research Ltd ) in response  to visually presented  cognitive  \ntasks  (attention, working memory, inhibition an d learning) . Brain activity using fNIRS ( Oxymon Mk II, Artinis  Ltd) was recorded \nat 10Hz across 12 ch annels (3  detector and 8 transmitter optodes)  spanning the prefrontal cortex  (see figure 1) . Data analysis was \nconducted  using MatLab and NIRS toolbox [see pipeline figure 1, Santosa et al., 2018 ]. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResults: Eye tracking data revealed significant improvements in reaction time and \naccuracy  in older adults  after left DLPFC stimulation , that revealed corresponding significant decreases in HbO under the site of \nstimulation  in this age group. Other tasks revealed  smaller  cognitive performa nce improvements , that w ere age specific . The fNIRS \ndata revealed  right DLPFC stimulation generally result ed in greater  effects  with increases and decreases in oxygenation consumption \ndepending on the tas k: (i) DWWenWion showed ipsilateral  reduction in HbO with contralateral increases , (ii) inKiEiWion  revealed \ncontralateral decreases , (iii) working memo ry had decreased HbO in both ipsi and contralateral optodes, and (iv) VeTXenFe O eDUninJ \nreflected a similar effect as attention but to a smaller exten t. Signi ficant e ffects were also age dependant.   \nConclusion :  This study contribute s novel  understanding  in the neural underpinnings of brain stimulation on cogniti ve function . We \nhave discovered that excita tory brain stimulation in duce s differential  effects  depend ing on the  hemi sphere of stimulation  thus \nindicat ing the left a nd right  DLPFC  perform  differen t functions in cognition. Furth ermore, we have found that age p lays an import ant \nfactor in the efficacy of brain stimulation and notable changes in perform ance. Some limitations of the study includes  the small \nsample size  used for each age group (n =15), and the  single dose of brain stimulat ion applied .

Our new, wearable, high-density (WHD), whole-head DOT \nsystem offers the high spatial resolution of conventional DOT, portability, and robustness to motion. \nWe demonstrate the system in vivo in laboratory conditions and naturalistic tasks, including walking, \nplaying piano, and social interaction. Even in unconstrained, natural, non-laboratory environments \nwith freely-moving participants, we detect brain activations consistent with known brain networks. \n \nIntroduction: Over the time, neuroimaging technologies have advanced towards the goal of a flexible, noninvasive, \nhigh-resolution, portable modality, but most established technologies face tradeoffs of portability, resolution, SNR, \nand motion susceptibility. Here we report a new WHD DOT system that offers whole-head coverage in a lightweight, \nportable design employable in a variety of contexts, from lab settings to fully naturalistic ones (Fig. 1b). \nMethods:  The WHD system consists of an array of modules with integrated optoelectronics and mechanics, with a \nhigh-density grid of 128 sources and 128 detectors covering the majority of the cortex (Fig. 1a). This fully untethered \nsystem communicates with a control computer over Wi-Fi, and power is supplied via a battery in a backpack. \nParticipants can move their head, stand, walk, interact with their environment, and perform more complex movements. \nWe demonstrate the system on the benchtop and in vivo, the latter in both traditional laboratory and naturalistic settings. \nResults: The WHD system’s benchtop metrics show a dynamic range of 121.1 dB, sensitivity of 13.5 𝑀𝑉/𝑊, \ndetectivity of 12.1 𝑓𝑊/√𝐻𝑧 𝑚𝑚ଶ , and NEP of 93 𝑓𝑊/√𝐻𝑧. In vivo activation maps are consistent with patterns from \nprior studies, using a variety of tasks including visual, auditory, and motor stimuli (Fig. 1c&d). Additional in vivo data \nfrom naturalistic environments and behaviors, including some unconstrained data collection sessions with social \ninteractions. While very preliminary, data from language regions correlates with natural language behavior (Fig. 1e). \nConclusions:  WHD DOT combines the portability of fNIRS and image quality of DOT to enable high-quality science \nin increasingly more ecologically valid studies and environments. \n \nFigure 1: WHD DOT   A)  The 256 optodes cover the head with a dense array that provides high spatial resolution and superficial signal demixing.

École de technologie sup érieure, Montr éal, Canada .                        \nContact: edouard.delaire@concordia.ca  \nAbstract:  Reconstructing fNIRS hemodynamic fluctuation s on the cortical surface is an ill -posed \nproblem that require s validation. The wavelet -based m aximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM)  \nmethod has recently been validated for the localization of EEG/MEG  resting -state activity. In this \nwork, we adapted wMEM for the localization of fNIRS resting state activity, validating it using \ncontrolled simulation s and localizing hemodynamic fluctuations during sleep.  \nIntroduction:  Hemodynamic signal s measure d using  fNIRS or fMRI ha ve been shown to display physiological \nfluctuations with specific frequency band s associated with specific physiological processes such as cardiac (0.8  - \n1.5hz), respiration (0.16 - 0.6Hz), low -frequency oscillations (0.04 - 0.15 Hz) and very low -frequency oscillations \n(0.01 – 0.04Hz). These oscillations have been proven to have associat ions with specific cognitive processes and to \nfluctuate during sleep  (Ren, Front. Neurol ., 2020 ). Therefore, w e aim to investigate and validate how accurately one \ncan reconstruct  spontaneous or evoked fNIRS  oscillation s on the cortex . To do so , we considered the wavelet \nMaximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM) method developed by our group  and recently validated for the \nreconstruction of resting state oscillations  of EEG/MEG  data (Afnan Neuroimage  2023).  wMEM  takes advantage of \ndiscrete wavelet representation of the fNIRS signals to reconstruct  resting state oscillations  on the cortical surface  for \nspecific frequenc y bands . Methods: Following our workflow described in Cai HBM  2021 , we acquired whole -night \npersonalized EEG -fNIRS data on a healthy subject . fNIRS optodes were glued  using a clinical adhesive targeting \nbilateral auditory cortices  (Machado JNS Methods  2018) . (1) For numeric simulation s, we extracted 22 minutes of \ndata showing no major motion artifact s during N2 and N3 sleep , before applying a standard  fNIRS  preprocessing \npipeline. We simulated transient oscillation s at 0.1Hz lasting 100s  and for different regions spanning across  the \ntemporal lobes, mixing  simulated fNIRS signals with resting -state data. After reconstructing the oscillation on the \ncortex using wMEM, we evaluated the spatial accuracy of the reconstruction based on the  minimum distance to the \nground truth  (Dmin ), the spatial dispersion  around the ground truth  (SD), and temporal accuracy (temporal correlation  \nwith simulated signals ). (2) To apply our method to real data , we first estimate d the hemodynamic response associated \nwith finger tapping , using an optimal montage targeting the right -hand knob area as described in Cai HBM  2021 . We \napplied wMEM  (and MNE)  reconstruction to the entire duration of the acquisition, before estimat ing the response by  \naverag ing the tapping  trials . Averaged response on the cortex was also obtained by  first averaging  the trial s at the \nsensor level before applying conventional MEM . (3) We  finally  evaluated  the performance of wMEM to reconstruct \nresting state data on the cortical surface , considering 20 minutes of signal acquired during N2 and N3 sleep . Following \n3D reconstruction, the  time-frequency representation of the signal for each vertex of the m iddle temporal gyrus  was \nobtained using  Morse continuous wavelet s. We then estimated  the average power spectrum over time in N2 and N3  \nusing  a bootstrap approach, averaging 5 \nsegments of 60 seconds randomly selected  in \neach sleep stage . Using a similar method, we \nalso estimated the power  spectr a at the sensor \nlevel . Results: (1) Our simulation results \nsuggest  that wMEM accurat ely reconstruct ed \nhemodynamic oscillations on  the cortex \n(Figure  1). (2) wMEM was able to ac curate ly \nrecover the response to the tapping task in the \nmotor region with overall similar localization \nas MNE and MEM  without the need to average \nthe tapping tri als first (Figure 2.a) . (3) We \nfound that estimating the power spectrum on \nthe cortical surface was able to better \ndisentangle N2 and N3 sleep , showing more clearly  an increase of power a round  0.03Hz for N2 after 3D \nreconstruction . We were also able to recover main oscillations  related to respiration  fluctuations (0.25Hz)  during both \nN2 and N3 (Figure 2.b) . Conclusion:  This study demonstrates the ability  of wMEM  to reconstruct  hemodynamic \noscillations  on the cortex . We have shown that wMEM can be used for the study of task -based experiments or resting \nstate analysis allowing accurate 3D reconstruction of ongoing resting state fNIRS signal s on the cortex.    1.

    "Investigating the consistency  of mental task-related fMRI \nand fNIRS brain -activation networks   \n \nDaniëlle Evenblij1, Michael Lührs1,2, Caroline Friedrich1, Nicole Dobreva1, Rainer Goebel1,2 \n& Bettina Sorger1 \n \n1Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands;  2Brain Innovation B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands  \nd.evenblij@maastrichtuniversity.nl , evenblij.d@gmail.com   \n \nAbstract:  We measured the consistency of eight mental task -related brain -activation networks \nobtained with 3 -T fMRI and fNIRS to investigate to which degree these brain -activation  maps \nmatch, despite the fNIRS’ considerably lower spatial resolution. Results show that brain -activation \nmaps are highly consistent for both HbO and HbR, and largely correspond to statistical maps \nobtained with fMRI, suggesting that fNIRS is a viable neur oimaging method for mental -task \nresearch and its applications.  \nIntroduction : Mental tasks  in neuroimaging have a \nmultitude of applications, from being used for mental task-\nbased brain -computer interfaces (BCI s) to neurofeedback. \nDespite considerable prevalence of fMRI studies in this \ndomain [1], it is still uncertain to what degree brain -\nactivation networks evoked by mental  tasks  can be obtained \nwith fNIRS, and whether they are consistent with fMRI \nresults, despite the fNIRS’ lower spatial resolution. To this \nend, we investigated the consistency of eight mental task-\nrelated brain -activation networks across fMRI and fNIRS.  \n \nMethods: Seven healthy participants performed eight  \ndifferent mental tasks ( Fig. 2) during separate sessions of 3 -\nT fMRI (Siemens Allegra, TR=1s) and continuous -wave \nfNIRS (NIRSport2, NIRx) (Fig. 1). Data analysis for both \nmodalities consisted of a Multi -study Fixed -Effects (FFX) \nGLM contrasting each mental task vs. rest  (FDR, p<0.05) . \n \nResults and conclusion : All mental task-related brain -\nactivation maps were highly consistent for HbO and HbR \nand showed remarkable overlap with fMRI maps ( Fig. 2). \nThis suggests that fNIRS is a viable neuroimaging method \nfor mental -task research and its applications. Next research steps will establish objective measures for estimating the \nsimilarity between fNIRS and fMRI mental -task brain -activation maps.  \n \n1. Tursic, A., Eck, J., Lührs, M., Linden, D.

    "AI-driven large-scale and automated neuroimaging and \nfNIRS data analysis pipeline using mega-datasets on \nNeuroJSON.io \n \nFan-Yu Yen1, and Qianqian Fang1,* \n \n1Department of Bioengineering, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, MA 02115, USA  \nyen.f @northeastern.edu  \nAbstract:  We present a proof -of-concept  that allows a user to use natural -language instructions to \nquery, retrieve rich neuroimaging datasets hosted on NeuroJSON.io and build data analysis \npipelines for large -scale fNIRS data processing. User prompts are converted to machine -actionable \ncommands using a large  language model (LLM). We show  automated anatomical scan segmentation, \n3-D mesh generation and mesh -based Monte Carlo simulations, but this framework can readily be \nexpanded to other types of analyses.  \n \nIntroduction:  NeuroJSON.io1 is a newly d eveloped data portal for sharing neuroimaging and biophotonics data. I t \nnot only allows users to navigate, preview and download large amounts of curated public imaging datasets in a web -\nbrowser, but also provides a universal data access interface, referred to as the REST -API (representational state \ntransfer application progr amming interface) to rapidly query, retrieve and process such data resources in any \nprogramming environments. Here, we show a proof -of-concept that allows any user to use natural language \ninstructions to build a simple fNIRS data analysis pipeline using datasets hosted on NeuroJSON.io. A  large language \nmodel (LLM) is used to convert user requests  to executable commands to download and process data.  \nMethods: We utilize an LLM, specifically Mistral AI 8x7B2, in combination with LangChain3 and Pydantic4 to \nconvert user prompts to a NeuroJSON -compatible JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  data query interface . This \nallows users to use natural language to describe their target dataset populations (e.g., age, gender, modalities)  and \nretrieve data to local storage.  Subsequently, we can further use LLM to execute data processing, including \nsegmentation of the MRI scans using SPM5, 3-D head mesh generation using  Brain2Mesh6 and perform mesh-based \nMonte Carlo (MMC)7 simulations over specific brain locations .  \nResults: A prototype Python script was created and \nsuccessfully converted various user quer ies into \nNeuroJSON API links . The script further  downloads \nthe returned MRI scans . Using  the retrieved data, we \nfurther applied brain segmentation using  SPM, \nfollowed by cal ling the Brain2Mesh toolbox to \ncreate the brain mesh models for all downloaded  \nsubjects. Users can then perform light simulation \naccording to their requirements for multiple subjects \nacross multiple databases (Fig. 1).  \nConclusion:  We demonstrated  a proof -of-concept \nworkflow showing the combined use of LLM with \nNeuroJSON.io REST -API can create scalable data \nanalysis pipelines. With simple modifications, this AI -guided system can also accommodate additional software and \nprocessing steps.  \nReferenc es: \n1.

    "Neural specificity for live dyadic face processing:   \nPreliminary TMS and fNIRS findings \n \nJoy Hirsch1,2,3,5,6, Adam Noah1, Xian Zhang1, Mark Tiede1, Nishant Rao4, David Ostry4 \nDepartments of Psychiatry1, Comparative Medicine2, Neuroscience3, Child Study Center4; Yale School of Medicine, Wu Tsai Institute5, Yale \nUniversity, New Haven, CT USA; Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering6, UCL, London, UK. \n \nAbstract The goal of this investigation is to understand the integrated neurophysiological \ncomponents associated with live and interactive social processes such as mutual face gaze.  \nFunctional near infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS, provides the imaging method of choice by enabling \nthe acquisition of images during live and natural interactions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, \nTMS, provides a method of choice for causal evidence of underlying neural correlates. We present \npreliminary data of TMS stimulation applied to fNIRS findings to test the hypothesis that right \nsupramarginal gyrus, SMG, is specialized for live face gaze.  \nIntroduction : Face-to-face social interaction is one of the primary ecological contexts for human social behavior.  The \nunderlying neurophysiology of live social interactions has emerged as an active area of research including advances \nfor clinical diagnosis and classification [1, 2]. We combine: 1) dual brain functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS; \n2) an experimental paradigm optimized for imaging of live interactive dyadic faces (a proxy for live social interaction); \nand 3) TMS, a neural disruptive technique, for causal evidence of functional \nspecificity. Prior findings suggest that the live face processing system is \nsensitive to in-person vs on-line face presentations [3] and these differences \nconsist of at least two separate neural components: the right supramarginal \ngyrus, rSMG, Fig 1A, specialized for live face encoding [4, 5] and Frontal \nEye Fields, rFEF, systems specialized for visual sensing, attention, and eye-\nmovement control [2].  This evidence, however, is based on task-based \ncorrelations without causal evidence for the proposed pathways. Here we \napply a method of cortical disruption using TMS for a causal test of the \nhypothesis. \nMethods: Functional data using fNIRS were acquired using a multi-modal \nSocial Interaction Suite, SIS, specialized for two-person interactive \nhyperscaning with paradigms previously described [1 – 5] including a \nShimadzu LABNIRS with 136 channels and dual Tobii Pro x3-120 eye-\ntracking systems. Two face-conditions: in-person and on-line were \ncompared Fig 1B [3]. TMS was applied as continuous theta burst \nstimulation, cTBS, using a standard figure eight coil and BrainSight \ntechnology to the rSMG (based on a T1 MRI scan acquired prior to the \nexperiment for the participant). Functional live face processing and eye-\ntracking data were acquired before and after the TMS. \nResults: Preliminary findings of this on-going experiment are illustrated in Fig 1C-F for a single participant showing \nexpected rSMG responses to the facial action unit regressor and to the eye-to-eye contact regressor prior to the TMS \nintervention (Fig 1,C-D). The functional activity Post TMS (Fig 1, E-F) is consistent with the hypothesis: functional \nactivity in the right SMG associated with the facial action units was reduced (Fig 1 E) and the rSMG was less \nmodulated by eye-to-eye contact regressor suggesting separate functional modules. \nConclusions : Preliminary findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the live face gaze and live visual sensing \nassociated with eye-to-eye contact are separate but cooperative pathways engaged during dyadic social face \ninteractions. \n \n[1] Zhang, X., et al.

P.2,3; \nTrobaugh , J. W.2; Culver, J. P.2,3; Durduran , T.1,4 \n \n1ICFO – Institut de Ciències Fotòniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08860 Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain; \n2Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA; 3Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA; 4Institució Catalana \nde Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), 08015 Barcelona, Spain. *faruk.beslija@icfo.eu  \n \nAbstract:  A high -density speckle contrast optical tomography system is introduced for in vivo  \ncerebral blood tomography of the adult head.  \n \nIntroduction:  Non-invasive measurement and mapping  of microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) are relevant for \nscience and healthcare.  Speckle contrast optical tomography (SCOT)  [1–3] is an emerging  modality for measuring \nblood flow that allows for easy scalability (low cost per detection channel, simple multiplexing ) and a good signal -to-\nnoise ratio (SNR)  with the promise to provide high -density (HD) optical tomographic mapping , analogous to diffuse \noptica l tomography  (DOT)  [4]. We have previously demonstrated   the feasibility of  HD-SCOT measuring CBF in \nadults  [5]. We now present a modular system based on this approach.  \n \nMethods: Our module -based HD-SCOT system  is designed according to our “instrument simulator”  [6], with 9 \nsources and 4 detectors  (3.2-by-3.2cm , Fig 1a. ), and can be upscale d to mimic  HD-DOT  [7]. Each module contains \n16 short (1.13cm) and 16 long (2.53cm) channels  (density : >3 channels/cm2) with a 785 nm laser, an optical switch \nand four cameras.  Sources are illuminated sequentially (20ms) with a full acquisition rate of 5.55 Hz.  We will present \ndetailed system architecture and test/validation results. Here we illustrate its ability to obtain HD, high SNR CBF \nmeasurements , during rest of 3  minutes , from left fronta l lobes ( n=4, 2f, age: 26.5+/ -1.5). Furthermore, we compared \nthe obtained speckle contrast  𝜅2, against the simulated range of expected physiological values for human adult  head . \n \nResults:  \n \nFigure 1. A) Probe layout. B) Representative 𝜅2 values ( one subject , one detector) for 4 short and 4 long channels. \nShaded areas represent simulated expected range of 𝜅2 when absorption coefficient is [0.08  – 0.15] cm-1, reduced \nscattering coefficient is [8  – 15] cm-1, and blood flow index is [1.5e -9 – 9e-9] cm2/s. C) SNR at primary and first \nharmonic of the cardiac pulse. Only one fundamental frequency and only 10 (out of 128 , all subjects ) first harmonics \nhave SNR <10dB, but never  <5.9dB, indicating that, at worst, they are about 2 times greater than the noise floor . \n \nConclusion:  We displayed the ability of our system to capture pulsatile blood flow from the  measurement on the \nforehead with a very high SNR across all channels. The obtained values are within expected physiological limits . We \nwill characterize the upscaled system and demonstrate it on functional tasks.  \n \nReferences : [1] Valdes et al. Biomed. Opt.

    "The Potential Role of Resting-State Spectral Entropy as a \nBiomarker in the Progression of Neurodegenerative Diseases \n \nMin-Kyoung Kang1, and Keum-Shik Hong1,2, * \n \n1School of Mechanical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Korea. \n2Institute For Future, School of Automation, Qingdao University, China  \n ({mk_kang, kshong}@pusan.ac.kr) * Corresponding author \n \nAbstract:  This study applies spectral entropy (SE) to resting-state functional near-infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) signals of degenerative brain diseases to analyze brain signal complexity in \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and healthy controls \n(HC). We show that the complexity variation of brain signals and the synchronization of complexity \nbetween brain regions varies with the severity of the degenerative brain disease. We investigate the \nfeasibility of analyzing SE from resting-state signals for future diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.  \n \nIntroduction:  People with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, have reduced complexity in their \nbrain signals, which can lead to impaired cognitive function and increased risk of psychiatric disorders. Neurological \nstudies have shown that the complexity of brain signals is not just noise, but an important indicator that correlates \nsignificantly with cognitive status. In this study, we analyze frequency complexity in a resting neurodegenerative \ndisease group and neural synchrony in complexity connectivity in prefrontal regions. \nMethods: The study included 19 AD patients, 37 MCI \npatients, and 27 HC patients recruited from Pusan National \nUniversity Hospital. 48-channel fNIRS signals were analyzed \nto obtain oxyhemoglobin (HbO), deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), \nand total hemoglobin (HbT) in the frontal lobe region during a \n250s resting state. SE analysis was performed divided into \nfrequency bands (very low frequency (VLF) (0.008-0.1 Hz), \nrespiratory (0.1-0.6 Hz), and cardiac (0.6-3.0 Hz)), and t-tests \nwere performed at the 0.05 significance level to compare SE \nvalues in each group. We also calculated correlations between \neach channel to examine synchronization with group \ncomplexity. Significant connectivity was tested at the 0.05 \nsignificance level. \nResults: For all hemodynamics in the VLF band, AD patients \nhad significantly higher SE values than MCI and HC patients. \nIn the respiratory band, all groups were significantly \ndifferentiated in HbO and HbR, with HC, MCI, and AD \nhaving the highest SE values. In the cardiac band, HC, AD, \nand MCI had the highest SE values, with significant \ndiscrimination between HbO and HbT. \nConclusion:  We found statistically significant differences in \nSE values in different frequency bands between AD, MCI, \nand HC groups, suggesting that the spectral entropy of fNIRS \nsignals is a promising marker of the complexity and \nadaptability of brain activity, offering the potential to \ndiagnose and monitor AD and MCI.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea under the Ministry of Science and ICT, Korea (grant no.

    "Establishing a n eural metabolism  resource trade-off \naccount of mental capacity limits: a B NIRS study \nM. Bruckmaier1, V. Albrecht1*, I. Tachtsidis2, N. Lavie1 \n1Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, Alexandra House, 17 -19 Queens Square, London , WC1N 3AZ, U K, \n2Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place , London , WC1E 7JE, U K \n*Joint first author:  vivien.albrecht.18@ucl.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract: We used broadband -NIRS (BNIRS) to measure oxidation states of cytochrome -c-\noxidase  (oxCCO) - an intracellular marker of neural  metabolism , during a visual perception \ntask in which we also assessed  task unrelated thoughts (TUTs) . We hypothesized that \nincreased demands on visual perception (high perceptual load) will reduce the level  of \nmetabolism  in medial -prefrontal -cortex  (mPFC)  associated with TUTs , compared to low \nperceptual load  due to shared capacity limits . Our findings indicate d that increased perceptual \nload resul ts in reduced TUT s-related oxCCO levels in mPFC . These r esults  demonstrate how \nBNIRS can be used to test neurobiological accounts of attention and capacity limits  in \ncognition.  \nIntroduction:  Overall  levels of cerebral metabolism are known to remain constant irrespective of mental task \ndemands1. This suggests that when an attended task involves increased processing demands ( i.e. higher \nperceptual load) metabolism levels underlying increased neural processing in task -related regions will be  \nincreased, and as a consequen ce, neural metabolism levels related to unattended processing  decrease . \nBruckmaier et al.  (2020)2, used BNIRS over occipital cortex and demonstrated that high perceptual load  in the \ntask was associated with increased oxCCO  levels related to attended processing together with a corresponding \ndecrease in oxCCO levels for unattended processing.  This suggests an attention r egulated trade -off in \nmetabolism resources between attended task processing and task -irrelevant processing , and can explain capacity \nlimits in cognition. Here we present a further test of this account3 investigat ing the effects of perceptual load  in a \nvisual task on oxCCO levels in the medial -prefrontal -cortex ( mPFC) in relation to TUT  reports .  \nMethods:  17 participants completed a task of either low or  high perceptual load  with intermittent  TUT  probe s \n(Fig. 1B). A 16-channel BNIRS system was placed over prefrontal cortex  (Fig. 1A). Channels were allocated to \nfour regions of interest (ROI) based on MNI coordinates  corresponding to mPFC (i.e. medial areas of BA9 and \nBA10 ) previously implicated in  TUTs4. For each ROI , 2x2 repeated measures ANOVAs  were run on the mean \noxCCO signal in the 15 seconds preceding a  TUT probe , as a function of  perceptual load (low vs. high load) and \nthe response to the TUT probe (TUT vs. Task Focus (TF)). To localize effects on a narrower  spatial scale, a \nchannel analyses was conducted on th e channels within the significant ROIs.  \n \nFigure 1. A) Average position of the 16 channels. B) T ask procedure. Perceptual \nload was varied through instruction . Low load  (colour feature search):  detect any \nred cross . High load  (search for conjunction of colour and orientation ): detect \nupright purple or inverted blue cross. The stream was interrupted at irregular \nintervals  with TUT probes.  \n \nResults: We found a significant interaction between oxCCO levels related to TUTs (vs . TF) and perceptual load \nin right BA  9 and right BA 10. The interaction re flected increased oxCCO signal s during TUTs under low  load, \nbut not under high load . Bootstrapping analysis clarified that effects were significant throughout the 15s \npreceding the TUT  probe. Channel analysis clarified that effects could be attributed to channels 8 and 6, \nconfirming that results were driven by midline areas within BA 9 and 10, in line with previous TUT research4. \nThe effects of perceptual load on the oxCCO signals related to TUTs  (vs. TF) support our attention regulation of \nmetabolism resources account for mental capacity limits  (see also  our previous study2). Reduced probability of \nTUT reports in high perceptual load provides  further support for this account.  \n \nConclusion:  Our results show  how BNIRS can be used t o investigate the relationship between the cognitive \nprocesses of attention and thoughts and the underlying neural metabolism .  \n1.

The\nincompatibility of ferrous materials with magnetic resonance imaging may explain the lack of\nresearch on neural mechanisms underpinning emotion perception in hearing aid users.\nThirty-seven older adults (20 normal hearing, 17 hearing aid users) listened to and categorically\njudged emotional speech while fNIRS recorded prefrontal, auditory and parietal regions.\nBehavioral results show that hearing aids do not improve accuracy or response time in speech\nemotion perception. Imaging results reveal differential patterns of brain activation based on\nhearing ability and whether participants wore their hearing aids.  \nIntroduction: Advancements in hearing aid research have improved speech intelligibility and quality of life for\nindividuals with hearing loss; however, hearing aids do not resolve all hearing challenges experienced by users.\nRecent research reveals that hearing aids do not improve the accuracy or response time of perceiving emotion in\nspeech in adults.\nSome research suggests that even mild hearing loss can lead to changes in neural activations when listening\nto emotional non-speech sounds. These neural changes may also contribute to the difficulties in perceiving emotion\nin speech, even when using hearing aids. However, prior neuroimaging studies required participants to remove their\naids since the ferromagnetic metals are incompatible with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This\nincompatibility may explain the lack of prior research on the neural mechanisms underpinning emotion perception in\nhearing aid users.\nUnderstanding the neural mechanisms involved in speech emotion perception can inform development of\ninterventions, design of hearing aids and new theoretical models of emotion perception. This study leverages fNIRS\nto explore the effect of hearing aids on brain function in experienced hearing aid users while perceiving emotion in\nspeech.\nMethods: Thirty-seven older adults (age 60+; 20 with normal hearing and 17 with hearing impairment who\nregularly use hearing aids) listened to and made categorical judgements (i.e., emotion recognition) on emotional\nspeech, while fNIRS recorded hemodynamic activity in several regions of interest: prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal\ngyrus, auditory cortex and parietal cortex. Participants were matched for age and cognition. The emotional speech\nstimuli were drawn from the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RA VDESS), a\nvalidated database of dynamic vocal expressions, to increase ecological validity. Hearing aid users completed the\ntask twice on separate days, once with their hearing aids and once without.\nfNIRS data were collected using an Artinis Dual-Brite system, consisting of 41 scalp channels and 4\nshort-separation channels. The data quality of each channel was assessed by its scalp-coupling index and peak\nspectral power through QTNIRS and preprocessed in Homer3. The locations of each source and detector on the\nscalp were digitized using the Polhemus PATRIOT and projected to cortical MNI coordinates using AtlasViewer.\nResults: Consistent with prior studies, older adults with normal hearing have better accuracy and faster response\ntime than those with hearing impairment. Additionally, when hearing impaired participants wore their hearing aids,\nit did not improve their accuracy or response time when perceiving emotion in speech.\nThe neural data show differential patterns of brain activation based on hearing ability and whether hearing\naid users wore their aids. The nature of these activation differences and their potential impact on emotion processing\nwill be discussed. Secondary analyses will consider functional connectivity, brain-behavior correlations as well as\nindividual differences such as time since onset of hearing loss.332 of 398",
    "Spatial global component filter vs short channel regression \nfor removing non -cortical component of fNIRS\nZhang, X., Noah, J.A., Singh,R., Hirsch,J \nYale School of Medicine ,  \nxzhang63@gmail.com  \nAbstract:  Non-cortical components can be prominent in fNIRS  recordings . The se components can \nbe related to blood pressure or respiratory activity  and should be removed to  measure reliable neural \nactivity or function al connectivity . Here we compare two methods for removing non-cortical \ncomponents, spatial global component filtering (GCR) and short channel regression (SCR) . SCR \nrequires short channel  signal acquisition  with high signal -to-noise ratio (SNR)  and only \nSNR /(1+SNR) of non -cortical component can be removed . GCR  requires large channel  coverage \nand will reduce  activity that has  large spatial extent . Both methods should be used in appropriate \nmanner .  \nIntroduction:  Noncortical component s [1] can manifest as false global activity, global connectivity and reduc e the \nneural  deoxy hemoglobin signal due to blood volume change. It is important to remove those  component s in optical \nneuroimaging . The influence  of noise on the effectiveness  of short channel regression  [2,3]  for removing non-cortical \ncomponent is presented. The strength s and limitation s of SCR and GCR  [4] are also discussed.  \nMethods: fNIRS data for a right finger -tapping task were acquired for 8 subjects with 96 channels and 8 short channels  \n[5]using a NIRx Scout 2 system . The non-cortical  components were removed with both GCR and SCR. Eight Short\nChannel s were used as 8 regressors . Linear regression finds the best β that minimize s RMS( )=RMS(fNIRS -β*Non -\nNeural) . When ShortChannel contains noise   shortchannel , we can only get RMS( fNIRS -β*Non-Neural)+RMS( -\nβ*shortchannel ). When  RMS( shortchannel ) is the same as  RMS( Non-Neural),  the linear regression cannot find the correct\nβ. Because of this extra random noise  was added to the short channel data to demonstrate the effect of noise on the\nSCR method. GCR assume the non -cortical component has a spatial extent of 46°  and the task related activities have\nmuch smaller spatial extent , a Gaussian spatial smooth ing filter is used for extracting the non -cortical component.\nResults: The average SNR  range s from 1.0 to 0.04 for oxyhemoglobin data and 0.43 to 0.03 for deoxyhemoglobin \ndata among  eight short channels. Compared to GCR, over 50% non -cortical component remain s present using SCR  \nmethod. Adding random noise to short channel data progressively  reduce s the effectiveness of SCR . \nConclusion:  Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin signal s contain non -cortical component s in addition to cortical \nactivities . Short channel data can contain random noise  and can only remove less than SNR /(1+SNR) portion of non -\ncortical components.  When using the GCR method applied to broad neural responses , it is necessary  to pay attention \nso that  actual neural signals  are not reduced .\nReferences  \n[1] Boas, et.al 2002; [2] Boas et al. 2004; [3] Gagnon et al. 2014 [4] Zhang et al. 2016.

Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Indiana University, USA , 2. Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's \nHospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA  \nAbstract:  This study explores  the effect s of anesthesia on individual functional connectivity \nfingerprinting  using Optical Intrinsic Signal (OIS) imaging in awake and anesthetized  mice . The \nidentification rates varied across networks and anesthesia groups, reaching a peak of 60% for the \nKetamine/Xylazine group and 66% for the Isoflurane group . The  awake group had the highest  \nidentification rate of 89% after extended  imaging  sessions  of 1 hour. These findings demonstrate \nthe varying effects of anesthetics on functional connectivity fingerprinting, offering important \ninsights for improving functional connectivity imaging in preclinical research.  \nIntroduction : Recent research has shown that functional connectivity -based fingerprinting can be used to assess \nindividual differences in brain function, which could lead to the development of biomarkers for disease and cognitive \nstates. However, certain clinical populations may require anesthesia during functional imaging studies, which could \naffect the individual organization of functional brain networks that support connectivity -based identification . This \nstudy aims to explore the feasibility of fingerpr inting despite the effects of anesthesia on a preclinical model. By \ncombining Optical Intrinsic Signal (OIS) imaging and resting -state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis, we use a \nmachine learning classifier to evaluate the individual identifiability of awake and anesthetized mice based on their \nindividual RSFC patterns.  \nMethods: Subjects and Imaging : OIS imaging was used follow ing established protocols [1, 2], with mice imaged in \n5-minute intervals up to 60 minutes across two days. We analyzed three groups: awake (N=8), anesthetized with \nKetamine/Xylazine (N= 35), and anesthetized with Isoflurane 0.4% (N= 28) \nFunctional  connectivity  analysis and subject -level c lassification : After preprocessing the individual OIS data , we \nperformed s eed-based correlation analysis  using  seeds associated with seven neural networks  (motor, somatosensory, \nvisual, retrosplenial, auditory, and olfactory ). To assess whether  individual subjects can be identified based on their \nRSFC  patterns , we used a random forest algorithm reinforced by data augmentation and evaluated through \nbootstrapping and Leave -One-Out Cross -Validation (LOOCV) for robustness and accuracy.  \n \nFigure 1. Identification rate s for different networks and data duration  (left: 30 minute s and right: 60 minutes ). \nResults: Our study reveale d RSFC patterns altered by anesthetics , achieving different  identification rates  within brain \nstates and networks  (Fig. 1). For the  Ketamine /Xylazine  (Ket/X y) group, the identification rate  increased from 58.4% \nat 30 minutes to 60.6% at 60 minutes, while  for the  Isoflurane (ISO)  group showed a rise from 6 1.4% at 30 minutes \nto 66% at 60 minutes. The awake group also had an increase from 75.3 % at 30 minutes to 88.9% at 60 minutes .  \nConclusion : This study confirms that anesthetics broadly influence RSFC  across various networks  and emphasizes  \nthat extended imaging sessions enhance identifiability, offering insights for optimizing functional connectivity \nimaging in preclinical research.  \nReferences \n1.

Paediat ric \nCritical Care Medicine, Children’s Hospital - London Health Science Center, London , Ontario, Canada.  \n \nbkrivoru @uwo.ca  \nAbstract:  Delirium is a serious condition in critically ill children  and is associated with increased \nmorbidity and longer hospital stay . However, diagnosis of delirium using behavior -based scores has \nlimitations. This study aims to be one of the first to  examine de lirium using functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate  the neura l correlates of  delirium , along with sedation, in \ncritically ill children . Results from five patients across two sessions revealed unique patterns of \nfunctional connectivity over time  in relation to increasing delirium and sedation scores. These \nexploratory findings highlight the potential of fNIRS for detection of delirium in  critically ill \nchildren.  \n \nIntroduction:  Delirium, characterized by alterations in attention, awareness, and cognition, is prevalent among \ncritically ill children , with significant implications for long-term morbidity and mortality. Delirium is  typically \ndiagnosed using behavioral screening tools  such as the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD)  score , \nhowever these tools have several  limitations  especially when symptomology is subtle . Functional n euroimaging  tools \nlike functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)  could offer valuable insights regarding functional connectivity \n(FC) and information flow in the brain, and  has the advantage of being easy -to-operate and portable . This exploratory \nstudy aims to investigate FC in critically ill children as delirium develops using fNIRS.  \n \nMethods: This study employed  a 20-minute resting -state fNIRS paradigm to monitor brain activity in 5 critically ill \nchildren  between the ages 17 month s to 13 years old ( 3 Males & 2 Females)  admitted to the Pediatric Critical Care \nUnit (PCCU) at the Children's Hospital -LHSC . Participants under went two separate  fNIRS sessions where participants \nlied relaxed  in their ICU bed wearing an 8x8 NIR Sport  cap with optodes over frontal and temporal brain regions . \nTo monitor delirium progression over  time, h ealth care professionals also collected delirium and sedation scores beside  \nusing validated behavioural measures (CAPD & COMFORT B) . Generalized estimating equations were used to \nexamine the relationship between channel pair functional connectivity and delirium and sedation scores, respectively.  \nModels testing the interaction between session, channel pairs and functional connectivity z scores  were created , \nadjusting for biological sex and age. Multiple comparisons were controlled for using the false discovery rate.   \n \nResults: When examining the functional connectivity  of the channel pairs  (171 comparisons per session) in relation \nto delirium scores  (M = 16.00 , SD = 3.29) during the first fNIRS scan, functional connectivity was increased between  \ntemporal regions along with fronto -temporal  connectivity  (p<0.006, FDR corrected) . In the later scan session when \ncomparing delirium scores ( M = 13.60 , SD = 2.65) and FC, this was not observed,  and overall decrease d associated \nconnectivity  was seen . Sedation  scores  were also assessed in separate model in relation to FC values , and in session  \none the scores ( M = 14.40 , SD = 4.41) showed  decreased  associated  FC values (p<0.00 7, FDR corrected ) in almost \nall the  significant channel pair  comparisons . As delirium progressed and was monitored in session two, this time \ngreater  sedation scores  (M = 14.75 , SD = 0.83) predicted increased functional connectivity  in m ajority of the  \nsignificant channel comparisons in the model . There was no significant effects of age or sex  in delirium  scores .  \n \nConclusion:  Our study is one of first to use fNIRS  in paediatric ICU patients with delirium to characterize their brain \nfunctional connectivity  and show a relationship to score s collected using validated  behavio ral measures . The results  \nrevealed nuanced findings , with f unctional connectivity values varying between  regions  and time . Our  exploratory \nfindings underscore fNIRS' value in characterizing brain function  in critically ill pediatric patients, potentially aiding \nin prediction and detection of delirium and other pathological brain states .  335 of 398",
    "Using Minecraft to investigate the Neurobiological \nMechanisms of Human Hunting Behaviour  \n \nEmre Yavuz  \n \nUniversity College London ,  \nucjueya@ucl.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  It remains untested whether the encoding system for distance and direction to stationary \ngoals in the human brain extends to moving goals. Here, we designed a multi -agent hunting task, \nwhere the target hunted is a human -controlled avatar, using the video g ame Minecraft. In this task, \ntwo human players – the ‘predators’ - will work together to chase after another human -controlled \ncharacter, the ‘prey’, whilst recording their brain activity using fNIRS, creating an environment that \nrealistically simulates gro up hunting. Preliminary analysis (n = 8) suggests roles for the lateral \nprefrontal cortex in human hunting behaviour.   \n \nRecent research has focused on spatial coding of other moving agents or moving objects  (Danjo et al., 2018; Omer et \nal., 2018; Stangl et al., 2020). Oscillatory power in the medial  temporal lobe (MTL) of a seated observer is sensitive \nto the spatial location of a watched  moving other individual (Stangl et al., 2020). The hippocampus also encodes \npredictions  about when a moving target will hit a boundary on a 2D display (Polti et al., 2021). Using a  2D display \nand joystick to control an icon chasing other ic ons, monkey dorsal anterior  cingulate cortex activity can predict a \nmoving target’s future location (Yoo et al., 2021).  However, it remains untested whether the encoding system for \ndistance and direction to  stationary goals in the human brain extends to moving goals. A classic situation where  \ntracking moving goals occurs is in hunting behavior (Goodroe and Spiers, 2022). How  encoding of distance and \ndirection to moving targets and broader brain dynamics relate to  hunting terrain remains unexplored. Recent \nunpublished work from the Spiers Lab has  created a VR hunting task where participants chase a moving goal whose \npath is altered by a  moving blocker agent, requiring participants to update internal representations of learned  routes \nand future goal positions. Preliminary analysis suggests interesting roles for the  dorsolateral prefrontal and frontopolar \nregions in coding future goals. Here, we extend this  approach to multi -agent hunting, where the target hunted is a \nhuman -controlled avatar,  using the video game Minecraft. In this task, two human players – the ‘predators’ - will work  \ntogether to chase after another human -controlled characte r, the ‘prey’, whilst recording  their brain activity using \nfNIRS, creating an environment that realistically simulates group  hunting. Preliminary analysis (n = 8) suggests roles \nfor the lateral prefrontal cortex in human  hunting behaviour.  \n336 of 398",

Five healthy subjects \nunderwent whole night EEG/fNIRS. We applied  Morse analytical wavelet to characterize the \noscillatory modes of oxyhemoglobin in different sleep stages, while removing the aperiodic 1/f \ncomponent. We found specific oxyhemoglobin oscillation signatures around 0.005 and 0.01Hz \nduring tonic and phasic Rapid-Eye-Movement sleep respectively, 0.03-0.06Hz during N2 sleep, and \n~0.2Hz during N3 sleep. We are reporting for the first-time sleep-state-specific spectral signatures \nof HbO oscillations, as a promising approach to characterize physiological and pathological sleep.  \nIntroduction:  Sleep includes Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) and Non-REM sleep stages, the latter further classified \nin N1, N2, N3 stages from light to deep sleep. Sleep stages are defined by specific EEG signatures, whereas EEG \nrhythms are also associated with brain hemodynamic activity. Recent EEG/fMRI studies revealed distinct oscillations \nin regional blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal at 0.04-0.07Hz during N2 correlated with spindles and at 0.15-\n0.18Hz during N3 correlated with slow waves (Song et al., 2022). Whereas EEG/fMRI sleep studies are difficult to \ncomplete (immobility constraints, noise, limited duration), simultaneous EEG/fNIRS emerges as a promising \nmultimodal approach for whole night sleep monitoring. However, due to limitations such as short sleep recordings or \nlimited spatial coverage, the physiology of sleep-related hemodynamic processes and their spatio-temporal \norganizations remains poorly understood. We propose all-night personalized EEG/fNIRS, using an optimized locally \ndense montage targeting bilateral frontoparietal regions, to investigate HbO oscillations during sleep in healthy \nsubjects. Methods: 5 subjects (2 females, 18-35 years, mean sleep efficiency: 90.3%) underwent whole night \nEEG/fNIRS. Sleep staging of EEG data was based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual. We applied our \nfNIRS workflow (Cai et al. 2021), optimizing the position of fNIRS sensors to target bilateral frontoparietal regions \n(2 light sources and 4 detectors per region). After applying standard fNIRS pre-processing, we applied time-frequency \nanalysis using Morse analytical wavelet, using the Taeger-Kaiser normalization to disentangle oscillatory from \naperiodic (1/f) components of HbO signals. HbO time-frequency results were considered to estimate HbO power \nspectra for each stable sleep state, \nincluding for the first-time REM \nphasic and tonic states. Results: in \nfrontal and parietal regions, we \nfound specific oxyhemoglobin \noscillation signatures, around 0.005 \nand 0.01Hz during tonic and phasic \nREM respectively, around 0.03-\n0.06Hz during N2, and ~0.2Hz \nduring N3 (mainly respiration).  \nConclusion:  w e  p r o p o s e  w h o l e -\nnight personalized EEG/fNIRS as a \nnew versatile modality to study \nsleep physiology, reporting specific \nspectral signatures of HbO \noscillations in different sleep states \nincluding for the first time REM \nphasic and tonic hemodynamic \ncharacteristics.     \n \n337 of 398",
    "Subjective and Objective Pain in Assessment in Alzheimer’s \nDisease and Related Dementia with fNIRS  \nSamuel Montero-Hernandez1, Luca Pollonini2, Juyoung Park2, Allison Huff2, Lindsey \nPark2, Lifeng Lin2, Hyochol Ahn2 \n1School of Computer Science, College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK , \n 2 Department of Engineering Technology, University of Houston, Houston, U S, \n 3College of Nursing, The University of Arizona , US \ns.montero@bham.ac.uk  \nAbstract:  Assessment of subjective (self - and caregiver -reported clinical pain scores) and objective \n(fNIRS) pain measures were conducted on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia populations. \nResults indicate that fNIRS pain -evoked responses exhibit a higher correlat ion with subjective \nmeasures reported in  participants with higher  cognitive function . \n \nIntroduction . Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) make up a number of incurable \nneurodegenerative brain disease s that disparately affect persons older than 65  and are often comorbid with chronic \npain. Some of the brain regions affected by ADRD are also involved in pain processing, making pain  assessment in \nolder adults with ADRD  challenging due to memory and judgment impairment and limited ability to report pain \nverbally  [1]. There is growing interest in objective, nonverbal, and noninvasive neuroimaging technology to measure \npain at the neural level, such as functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) . The purpose of this study was to \ndetermine whether fNIRS is a reliable and accurate objective measure for older adults with early -stage ADRD.   \nMethods. Forty persons with  mild to moderate  dementia  determined using  the Montreal Cognitive Assessment  \n(MoCA ) were exposed to thermal pain stimulation  (three 20 -sec low-intensity thermal stimuli  blocks and 30-sec \ninterstimulus interval) . At the end of the each fNIRS session,  two subjective  clinical pain scores were collected: 1)  \nself-report of pain intensity  Numerical Rating Scale  (NRS)  and caregiver’s observational pain intensity report \nMobilization -Observation -Behavior -Intensity -Dementia -2 (MOBID -2). A 20-channel  fNIRS imaging system \n(LIGHTNIRS, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow  on prefrontal \nand somatosensory  cortices  bilaterally  during pain  stimulation . Raw optical measurements  were  converted  into optical \ndensities, correct ed for motion artifacts , band -pass filter ed (0.01 -0.5 Hz), conver ted to oxy - (HbO) and deoxy -\nhemoglobin (HbR) changes using the Modified Beer -Lambert Law. Hemodynamic response s functions (HRFs) were \ncomputed using the g eneral linear model (GLM) analysis using a consecutive sequence of Gaussian functions  [2]. For \ngroup analysis, p articipants were grouped into low (LCF) and high cognitive function  (HCF) with MoCA<22  and \nMoCA> =22, respectively . Then, f or each channel  and group , HRFs  were averaged across subjects . Active channels \nwere determined based  on the statistical significance of the responses  based on  pre-stimulation vs stimulation ( t-test \nand a= 0.05 ). At the group level, we computed the area under the curve of the HRF  from  active channels; AUC(HRF) \nand correlated them with subjective pain measures NRS and MOBID -2 using Pearson correlation  and computed the \nsignificant  correlation values (T-test with the null case of zero correlation ). \nResults and Conclusion . LCF group showed deactivation patterns in the left sensorimotor cortex , while the HCF \ngroup  showed  activation profiles  in both left and right  sensorimotor cortex . Results indicated  a strong and significant \ncorrelation  within the HCF  group  between NRS and Hb O (left prefrontal cortex and right sensorimotor regions , Fig. \n1) and between  MOBID -2 and HbR (left sensorimotor  area). No statistically significant correlations emerged within \nthe LCF group . Our r esults suggest the area under the curve of the hemodynamic response is a relevant fNIRS feature \nin pain management studies to describe an objective pain management level  which is higher correlated  with subjective \nmeasures reported in the  HCF population . \n \n \nFigure 1 NRS-fNIRS Correlation.

Xu3, Sossena Wood1,2 \n \n1Biomedical Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213  \n2Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213  \n3Hematology  Oncolo gy, University  of Pitt sburgh , Pittsburgh, PA, 15213  \n \nAbstract:  Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that leads to anemia, chronic \norgan damage, and severe  neurological complications . We used continuous wave near -infrared \nspectroscopy (CW -NIRS) to analyze hemodynamic responses in controls  and adult patients with \nSCD during a cognitive task that assesses processing speed. Our preliminary analysis shows \nsignificant differences in hemodynamic responses between SCD and controls (SCD: −0.02±0.06, \ncontrols : 0.07±0.09; )\t<\t0.05). These findings suggest the utility of  using hemodynamic \nresponse  measured by a portable CW-NIRS  instrument  as a functional biomarker to assess cognitive \nfunction in patients with SCD at the bedside.  \nIntroduction : SCD is a genetic blood disorder that causes  red \nblood cells to deform and  break down , obstructing blood flow \nand producing anemia,  ultimately diminishing oxygen -carrying \nand delivery capacity  to tissues such as the brain . Research has \nconsistently shown  that patients with SCD experience lower \ncognitive abilities such as processing speed, working memory , \nand executive function ing across all age groups.  While existing \nliterature focuses on the cognitive effects during  child hood , \nthere is still uncertainty about the  impact on adults  living with \nSCD . Our study aims to address  this gap by leveraging  NIRS , a \nnon-invasive, cost -effective, and portable tool, to capture \nhemodynamic responses associated with cognitive tasks  and \nprovide a deeper understanding beyond behavioral responses . \nThus, we hypothesize that there are differences in the  \nhemodynamic response  linked to  processing speed during the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST)  task.   \nMethods: This study enrolled 9 adult patients with SCD and 6 race-matched  controls . We measured hemodynamic \nchanges from the prefrontal cortex to assess processing speed  using the Portalite MKII NIRS device at a sampling \nfrequency of 50 Hz. Participants responded to a digit -symbol key stimulus and prompt within 4  seconds, followed by \na 10 -15 second jittered rest, and the task comprised  36 trials over two blocks. We obtained the change in \noxyhemoglobin (Δ[HbO]) from the modified Beer -Lambert law and filtered out the  very low -frequency drift and \ncardiac pulse. General Linear Model (GLM) analyses required  a design matrix comprised of 11 regressors. The beta \nvalues associated with expected hemodynamic responses were obtained using the iterative re -weighted least square \nestimation method [2].  \nResults: GLM analysis of the DSST  task revealed significant beta value differences between controls  and patients \nwith SCD (SCD: −0.02±0.06, Controls : 0.07±0.09; p < 0.05 ).  Figure 1 demonstrates that, on average, patients \nwith SCD exhibit lower beta values , which shows poor agreement with the expected response .  \nConclusion:  In conclusion, o ur preliminary results demonstrate the potential of using hemodynamic responses to a \nDSST task as a functional biomarker to highlight the cognitive impact of  SCD. Fu ture research will incorporate a \nblocked experimental design  to improve the effect size  and overcome the constraints posed by the short stimulus \nduration ( 2.36\t±\t0.69/) of each trial in our current work. Such an approach will be pivotal in thoroughly exploring \nthe capabilities of CW -NIRS -derived hemodynamic responses during DSST to serve as a robust biomarker of \npsychomotor speed in SCD.  \nReferences  \n1.

    "Speaker-listener hyp erscanning during oral story telling \n \nDan P. Dewey, Jacob Hatcher, Jamin Rowan, Mat Duerden, Camilla Hodge \n \nBrigham Youn g University Linguistics fNI RS Applied Neurolinguistics Lab, 4064 JFSB, Prov, UT, 84602, USA  \nddewey@byu.edu  \n \nAbstract:  fNIRS speaker -listener hyper scanning during the  telling of short personal  stories by 8 \nundergraduate students at a  public  organized university event revealed significant  interbrain \nsynchrony throughout the stories but varying connectivity patterns at different stages of each story. \nSpecifically, left and right DLPFC speaker -listener co nnectivity was largely evident throu ghout but \nstrongest when the speaker was  articulating insight s gained when tackling a personal \nchallenge/complication.  Correlations were similar ly high during thi s ins ight stage for the SFG.  \nSince this insight stage typically occurred  later in the story , the data suggest greater connectivity \npossibly attributable to extended listening  to the story and/or to  this specific stage.  \n \nIntroduction:  Oral storytelling and a sense of narrative structure  develops early in life . Research has shown that \nnarrative s tructure can be mapped onto sp ecific cortical areas (Baldassano et al., 2 021). In this study, we examine \nrelationshi ps between cortical activity and three specific narrative feat ures: need, complication, and insight.  Need  can \ninvolve  physical, social, cognitive, emotional, or other dimensions; complication might be viewed with typical \nnarrative lenses ( Hyvärinen , 2008), and insight sometimes labeled epiphany, turning point, or catharsis. We focus  on \nneural coupling between speakers and listeners during these st ory pieces using fNIRS hyperscanning.  \n \nMethods: fNIRS data were collected from 8 story tellers and 24 listeners using  22-channel frontal head band s \nconnected NIRx NIRSport2  units. Stories lasted 4-8 minutes each . Hyperscanning was conducted through out each \nstory, and st ory s tructures/stages were manuall y triggered. Pre-processing of data included SC I channel rejection , \nspike r emoval, TDDR motion correction, high- and low -pass t emporal filtering, and z -transform norm alization.  \nDifferences in activity acr oss events and between group s were calculated us ing GLM modeling . \n \nResults: Results  show neural synchrony throughout the stories between  left and right DLPFC  of speakers and l isteners.  \nDLPFC and S FG correlations were  strongest when the speaker was  articulating insight s gained when tackling a \npersonal challenge/complication , and there were  significant  differences in terms of re gions of interest activated and \nsynchronized between t he three primary story elements/stages.  \n \nConclusion:  Results s uggest neural coupling between s tory tellers and story listeners .  More specifically, they suggest \nthat this coupling can be stronger depending on th e narrative stage and timing in the story.   Our next step is to carry \nout wavelet coherence analysis to better understand the data  (Zhang et al. , 2020).  \n \nReferences  \n \n1. Baldassano, C., Chen, J., Zadbood, A., \nPillow, J.

However, despite their potential, un - and semi -supervised detection  have yet to \nbe utilized for bad channel detection, and a comprehensive assessment is lacking. We developed \nthree novel detectors and compared them with established methods, un - and semi -supervised \ntechniques. Machine  learning approaches that utilize partially rated data, particularly  the here \ndeveloped NiReject,  achieved superior performance . This may pave the way for improved , \nautomated quality control in fNIRS and artificial intelligence -based developments  for such control.  \n \nIntroduction:  The increasing sample sizes and density in functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and channel \ndensities necessitate precise and scalable identification of signals that do not permit reliable analysis. Yet, the behavior \nof current detection methods a nd the potential of unsupervised and semi -supervised machine learning (ML) in \nidentifying these “bad channels” remain largely unexplored.  \nMethods: We provide d a comprehensive overview of current detection methods based on a systematic literature \nsearch, demonstrate d their impact on research findings  using widely  applied preprocessing methods and GLM -based \nanalysis , and develop ed three novel ML based detectors, unsupervised -, semi -supervised -, and hybrid NiReject .  Based \non 29,924 signals from two independently rated datasets and a simulated scenario space of diverse bad channel \nphenomena, we compared the performance of NiReject, six most established detection methods  in fNIRS, and eleven \nprominent methods from other domains.  Following best practices for detection benchmarks in ML, precision , ROC -\nAUC , AUC -PR served as performance metrics on a repeated stratified train -test split procedure.  \nResults: Although our results indicate d that a lack of proper bad channel detection can strongly bias findings, detection \nmethods were applied in only 32% of the included studies. In the real -world  datasets, un - and semi -supervised machine \nlearning -based detectors outperformed established thresholding -based methods, such as the scalp -coupling index  \n(SCI) . Semi -supervised NiReject , which depends on only partially rated data,  demonstrated best performance  and had \na low number of false positives, thus, prevent ing subsequent analyses from having reduced statistical power . No single \nestablished detection method excelled across all simulated bad channel phenomena, indicating that they are \ncomplementary in nature.  Varying the percentage of bad channels showed that NiReject but also the SCI performed \nreliably, which is important  particularly important in settings  with potentially more noise contamination , such as \nnaturalistic tasks, developmental or clinical populations . Semi -supervised methods demanded only  a few rated bad \nchannels and proved robust even when several ratings were incorrect. Hybrid NiReject , which incorporates a human \nfeedback loop, showed a substantial performance gain over unsupervised detection while obviating  the high rating \neffort  of supervised  detectors  and the practical challenges of semi -supervised detectors.  \nConclusion:  This study assesses  current and introduces novel, more precise detection methods for bad channels in \nfNIRS. ML detectors that leverage partially rated data, particularly NiReject , achieved superior detection performance \ncompared to thresholding -based and unsupervised detectors across various settings. The probed key characteristics \nreveal ed how detectors differ in their performance capacities, cost -efficiency, and robustness under varying \nconditions. This paves  the way for improved and automated signal quality control in fNIRS and future ML -based \ndevelopments in  data quality control and correction, applicable across a wide range of populations and environments \nto ensure robust, high -quality neuroimaging findings . 342 of 398",
    "Effect of Baseline on Prefrontal Brain Activity during \nSingle- and Dual-Task Walking in Healthy Adults and \nPersons with Parkinson’s Disease \n \nRini I. Kaplana,d, Nishaat Mukadama,d, Courtney Aula,d, Timothy Nordahlb, Nicole M. \nEklundb, Meryem A. Yücelc,d, Terry D. Ellisb,d, & Alice Cronin-Golomba,d \n \naDepartment of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University, USA  \nbDepartment of Physical Therapy, Boston University, USA  \ncDepartment  of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, USA  \ndNeurophotonics Center, Boston University, USA  \nPresenting Author email address: kaplanri@bu.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to examine the impact of \ndifferent baselines on changes in oxygenated hemoglobin ( ∆HbO) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) \nduring a cognitive task, single -task (ST) walking, and dual -task (DT) walking in healthy young \nadults (HYA), healthy older adults (HOA), and persons with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD). Baseline \nhad a greater impact on ∆HbO during both walking tasks in PwPD , and during the cognitive task in \nPwPD and HOA. While baseline did not have an impac t in HYA, there was more variability within \nthe PFC in this group than the others during  the cognitive task.  \n \nIntroduction:  Although  fNIRS  has great potential for our ability to understand brain states during everyday tasks, \ncurrent experimental paradigms , especially block design s, have low ecological validity , particularly with the need to \nreturn to rest (or other specified baseline)  between trials. Switching between tasks without returning to baseline is \ncommon in everyday scenarios . We aimed to mimic everyday conditions  with a new experimental protocol in which \nwe examined performance on each task relative to the task that preceded it  (i.e., varied the baseline for each trial) .  \nMethods: 10 HYA, 12 HOA , and 12 PwPD  engaged in three tasks: standing cognition (serial -3 subtraction); ST \nwalking at a self -selected comfortable speed on a 24.5m oval -shaped course; and DT cognition+ walking on th e same  \noverground course , each  for 30 seconds per trial. Four runs were completed and t asks were randomized within a single \nrun so that there were three trials of each task per run, and the preceding task (i.e., baseline)  was different for each of \nthese three trials. fNIRS data were collected using  a NIRx NIRSport2  consisting of 16 sources, 15 detectors, and 8 \nshort separation detectors in the following cortical ROIs: right and left inferior  frontal (RLF, LLF), right and left \nmiddle  frontal (RMF, LMF), right and left superior frontal (RSF, LSF), and right and left premotor (R PM, L PM). \nfNIRS data  (∆HbO)  were analyzed in Homer3 using a spline SG motion correction and the ordinary least squares \nmethod in the general liner model. Three -way mixed  analysis of variance  (ANOVA)  and post -hoc two-way repeated \nmeasures ANOVAs were  applied  to each condition, with Benjamini -Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons .  \nResults: For all conditions.  there was a significant three -way interaction between group, ROI, and baseline . For \nstanding cognition, there was a significant two -way interaction between ROI and baseline for HYA  and for HOA, but \nnot for PwPD . There was a significant simple main effect of ROI for HYA , but not for HOA and PwPD,  and of \nbaseline for HOA and PwPD , but not for HYA. For ST walking , there was a significant two -way interaction between \nROI and baseline for HYA , HOA , and PwPD . There was a significant simple main effect of ROI for HYA , but not \nfor HOA and PwPD , and of baseline for PwPD , but not for HYA or HOA. For DT cognition+walking , there was a \nsignificant two -way interaction between ROI and baseline for HYA , HOA , and PwPD. There was a significant simple  \nmain effect of ROI for HYA , but not for HOA and PwPD , and of baseline for PwPD , but not HYA and HOA . All \nsignificant results were corrected p’s <.05.  \nConclusion:  There were measurable differences in brain activity in PFC regions during a cognitive task, ST walking, \nand DT walking across participant groups  following  this protocol using varying baselines . Specifically, there was an \neffect of ROI in HYA for all three tasks, suggesting that differentiation between PFC subregions during these tasks \nwas more prominent in HYA  than the two older groups . There was an effect of baseline in HOA and PwPD  but not \nHYA during standing cognition , suggesting that switching between tasks may become more difficult with age and in \nPD. For walking tasks , baseline had an effect in PwPD  only, suggesting that PwPD may have more difficulty when \nswitching to tasks with a motor component. Further investi gation is needed to determine if this finding may be  related \nto PD motor sy mptoms.  343 of 398",
    "Cerebral hemodynamics assessed with a wearable, low -cost \nNIRS device toward glymphatic flux estimation     \n \nNikola Otica,b, Marco Rennaa, Sydney M Bailesb,c, Laura D Lewisa,c, Maria Angela \nFranceschinia, Mitchell B Robinsona \n \naAthinoula  A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, \nMassachusetts, United States  \nbDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States \ncDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Insti tute of \nTechnology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States  \nmitchell.robinson@mgh.harvard.edu  \n \nAbstract:  Sleep is an essential mechanism for the maintenance of brain health and cognitive \nperformance. A key feature of sleep is the clearance of the buildup of metabolic waste products \nthrough what has been termed the glymphatic system.  Most investigations of the glymphatic system \nhave been performed with invasive imaging in animals, though measurements in humans have been \nperformed with MRI. To move toward a more ecologically viable measurement of the glymphatic \nsystem in humans, we hav e applied a recently developed, wearable, wireless NIRS device to \nmeasure hemodynamic activity correlated with flow in the glymphatic system during naturalistic \nsleep.  \n \nIntroduction:  Sleep plays a vital role in the maintenance of cerebral \nhealth and high -level cognitive function1. One of the  functions that occurs \nduring sleep is the increased clearance of waste through what has been \ntermed the glymphatic (glial -lymphatic) system2. Through a combination \nof cellular mechanisms and increased low frequency arterial fluctuations  \n(0.01 Hz to 0. 15 Hz) , fluid exchange from the arteries to the cerebral \nspinal fluid (CSF) and CSF to the veins increases and takes with it \nmetabolic waste produced by neurons. Disruption of metabolic waste \nclearance has been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative \ndisease, though methods to assess glymphatic function at a population \nlevel during naturalistic sleep are not currently available. To assess  \nglymphatic function  in ecologically valid settings , we leverage a low -cost, \nopen -source, near -infrared spectro scopy (NIRS) instrument called the \nFlexNIRS3 to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring  low frequency, \ncerebral hemodynamic fluctuations during sleep.  \nMethods: The FlexNIRS device was worn by subjects during sleep , and changes in light intensity were assessed at \ntwo wavelengths and 3 source -detector distances (Figure 1 a). Cerebrally specific low frequency oscillations (LFO) \nwere extracted using short -separation regression on the long separation signals. Comparisons of the amplitudes of the \nfluctuations in the low frequency band were performed as a function of sleep stage.   \nResults: LFOs  were observed in each of the subjects measured  in the regressed long separation signals , with \namplitudes that varied throughout the night consistently with changes in sleep stage  (Figure 1b). Significant LFOs \nwere measured also in the short separation signals, indicating the contribution of systemic hemodynamics to the \ncerebral LFOs .   \nConclusion : In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of full night recordings of cerebral hemodynamics  with the \nFlexNIRS and the detection of LFO  typically associated with glymphatic flow4.Future work will expand the \nwavelength range of the FlexNIRS device to estimate tissue water content in addition to cerebral hemoglobin \nconcentrations.  \n \n1.

    "The social brain network  & adolescent screen time  \n  \nMichaela Kenta, Homa Vahidia,b, Brian Krivoruk a, & Emma G. Duerdena,b \n  \na Western Institute for Neuroscience, Western University,  London, Ontario, Canada  \nb Faculty of Education, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada  \nmkent28@uwo.ca  \n  \nAbstract: During the COVID -19 pandemic we saw dramatic increases in reliance on screens \nand daily screen time use , especially  for young people . Adolescence is a period of rapid \nmaturation in brain areas relating to social cognition  and as a result of excessive  screen use \ntypical social behaviours such as mentalizing and the underlying neural activity were disrupted. \nIn the current study, we investigate the association of  screen time on social brain activity and \nfunctional connectivity in adolescents  using a validated social perception task . \n  \nIntroduction: The effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on screen time habits and social behaviours  were seen in \nall age groups, though perhaps the most significant changes could be observed in adolescents. Previous research \nhas linked high screen time use with structural changes in socio -cognitive brain regions [1]. In the current study, \nwe use d fNIRS to measure responses and functional connectivity between brain regions associated with social \ncognition.  Specifically, we examined  brain responses in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporoparietal \njunction (TPJ), which are commonly associated with socio -cognitive processes , including mentalizing . We \nhypothesize d that greater screen time would be associated with decreased activation in socio -cognitive brain \nregions during a mentalizing task, and that at rest these brain regions will show lower levels of  network  functional  \nconnectivity compared to adolescents with low screen time.  \n \nMethods: Data collection for this project is currently ongoing . Participants  (n = 5, average age = 13 years , 3 \nmales)  completed a single fNIRS data collection session . Self-reported measures of screen time use were collected \nusing a modified version of the SCREENS -Q [2]. fNIRS t ask d ata were  recorded during a short localizer for \n“Theory of Mind”  (Disney Pixar’s  Partly Cloudy ) and r esting state data were recorded while participants  watched \na computer -generated animation (Inscapes ). Data were acquired  using a NIRx NIRScout system  (NIRx medical \nsystems, Berlin, Germany) with 14 sources and 19 detectors covering cortical regions of interest  (mPFC & TPJ) . \nData were preprocessed and analyzed using  the AnalyzIR  toolbox and custom scripts in MATLAB (2022b).   \n \nResults: Screen time on average was over 5 hours per day.  We first evaluate d the hemodynamic response in the  \nfunctional  localizer to assess whether there are significant differences between Theory of Mind events relative to \nPain events in the movie. Using the localizer, we isolate d channels of interest  as channels that showed a significant \nresponse to the Theory of Mind events  over the left and right TPJ and PFC . Current results suggest two channels \nover left TPJ and one channel over right TPJ were selective for mentalizing events ( p < 0.05) . To determine \nwhether screen time is associated with functional connectivity in social brain areas  we test  connectivity  between \nchannels in the network, with initial trends indicating increased activity between mPFC and TPJ .  \n \nConclusion: As we move forward and adapt to an increasingly digital world, clear guidelines are needed \nconcerning the amounts, types, and content of screen time that are most harmful to adolescents'  brain development.  \nA better understanding of the relationship between screen usage and the strength of social brain networks may  \nhelp to inform policy and guidelines on screen time in adolescents.  \n \nReferences:  \n1.

    "Infants’ Motor System Responses to Beat Structure in \nSound Sequences \nAnagha Vinod, Daniel Cameron, Senaya Karunarathne, Daniel Lee, Danny Nguyen, Jason Lau, & Naiqi G. Xiao  \nPsychology, Neuroscience, & Behaviour, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada  \nvinoda@mcmaster.ca \nAbstract: Beat perception plays a critical role in both speech and music processing. The present \nstudy explored its developmental origin via investigating infants’ localized neural responses to \ntemporally structured auditory stimulation using fNIRS. We measured activity in the Supplementary \nMotor Area (SMA), a region implicated in timing prediction in adults, while infants listened to beat and \nnon-beat sound sequences. We hypothesized a stronger activation for beat compared to non-beat \nsequences. Our findings reveale d increased SMA activity for beat sequences. Furthermore, this effect \nwas more pronounced in infants older than 9 months than younger infants, suggesting a \ndevelopmental progression in beat perception. \nIntroduction : Auditory sequences with a temporal structure often elicit spontaneous motor synchronization, aiding \nin the prediction of beat timing2. While previous research suggests that infants can neurally entrain to rhythms3, the \nspecific brain regions involved remain largely unexplored. In adults, the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and basal \nganglia exhibit increased activation when processing rhythmic auditory stimuli compared to non -rhythmic stimuli1. \nThe present study investigates the functional role of the SMA in preverbal infants to elucidate the early developmental \ntrajectory of this neural signature. If infant SMA activation is enhanced for beat -based sequences compared to non -\nbeat-based sequences,  it would suggest that motor synchronization ability, which typically emerges around 3 -5 years \nof age, is not a prerequisite for making timing predictions.  \nMethods: We recruited 55 infants aged 6-15 months  and measured their localized cortical brain activity  using  the \nHitachi ETG 4000  fNIRS system. Infants listened to sound sequences that either elicited a sense of beat  (Beat \ncondi tion) o r had a tempo rally random  structure  (Non-Beat condition ). To assess the generalizability of infants' SMA \nresponse to beat perception, we manipulated several low -level acoustic features, including stimuli loudness (Loud & \nQuiet), tempo (150ms, 200ms, & 250ms), timbre (piano, glockenspiel, & marimba), and pitch (C3  & C5 notes). A \nblock design was employed for stimuli presentation  (15s of sound followed by a 13 -17s second jittered silence period ) \nfor a total of 36 blocks. Three static images of objects  were presented concurrently with the auditory stimuli.  \nResults: NIRS data were preprocessed using Homer3 software. Oxy -hemoglobin concentration in channels over the \nSMA region was averaged and normalized for both Beat and Non -Beat conditions. To estimate overall responses, a \ntime window between 5 to 18 seconds after st imuli onset was selected, and oxy -hemoglobin concentration within this \nwindow was averaged. Results revealed greater SMA activity for the Beat condition compared to the Non -Beat \ncondition ( Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of this response to beat structure, we compared SMA activity between \nLoud and Quiet sequences, finding no significant difference. This suggests that the observed SMA activation is \nspecifically related to the perception of beat  structure rather than general auditory processing. To examine the \ndevelopmental trajectory of this effect, we divided the data based on the median age (9 months) and compared SMA \nactivity between age groups. Older infants (9 -15 months) exhibited increased  SMA activity for Beat compared to Non -\nBeat sequences, while younger infants (6 -9 months) showed no such difference ( Fig. 1B).  \nFigure 1: Infants’ SMA response s to beat \nstructure  in audio sequences.  A) Increased oxy-\nhemog lobin con centration  in SMA in Beat \ncondition compared to Non-Beat condition. B)  \nIncreased SMA oxy -hemoglobin concentration in \nBeat con dition compared to Non-Beat condition \nin old er infants ( 9-15 months)  \nConclusion: These finding s suggest  that the SMA \nmay be involved in making timing predictions for \ntemporally structured auditory stimuli early in \ndevelopment. Furthermore, the observed age -related increase in this effect suggests a developmental progression in \nthe functional role of the SMA in beat perception and prediction. These findings contribute to our understanding of \nthe neural underpinnings of early rhythmic processing and highlight the importance of the SMA in this process.  \nReferences  \n1.Grahn, J.

    "Measuring cortical activity during motor imitation and \nobservation in autistic and non -autistic adults and children \nTessa G. George1, Dalin Yang1, Chloe M. Sobolewski1, Sophia R. McMorrow1, Sung Min Park1, Mary Beth \nNebel2, Bahar Tuncgenc4 Rene Vidal5, Natasha M. Marrus1, Stewart H. Mostofsky2,3, Adam T. Eggebrecht1.\n1Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis ; 2Kennedy Krieger Institute  ;3Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; 4University \nof Nottingham ; 5University of Pennsylvania  \nAbstract: Neural profiles of motor imitation deficits in autism are unknown due to imaging \nmodality constraints. We leveraged high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT) and \ncomputer -vision based imitation assessments  to simultaneously map brain function and measure \nimitation fidelity in autistic and non -autistic adults and childre n. Neural responses to motor \nobservation and imitation show localized activations in visual, temporal, and motor cortex.  Multiple \ncortical regions are differentially activated in  adult and pediatric  autistic  and non -autistic  cohorts .  \nIntroduction : Motor i mitation is crucial to normative social -communicati on development, and imitation deficits are \nlinked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1,2. Elucidating  neural signatures  of autism -associated behavioral differences \nin motor imitation has proved challenging due to constraints with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \nHigh -density diffuse optical tomography (HD -DOT) provides an open scanning environment conducive to \nneuroimaging during motor imitation. We used HD-DOT to investigate brain -behavior associations underlying motor \nimitation and observation in autistic and non -autistic control (NAC)  adults and  school -age children .  \nMethods: We imaged 97  adults  (18-74 years; 20 ASD) and 53 children  (7-16 years; 19 ASD) with HD -DOT3 (Fig. \n1A) during motor observation and motor imitation . Participants observed or imitated videos of an actor completing \nsequences of arm movements . Participants were concurrently recorded with Kinect 3D cameras for computer -vision -\nbased assessment of motor imitation (CAMI , Fig. 1B). HD-DOT data were processed using NeuroDOT \n(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/neurodot ) MATLAB pipelines, including head motion detection and censoring with \nglobal variance of the temporal derivative4. We used general linear model ling to compute beta values of the stimulus \nresponse relative to rest (e.g., imitation>rest ), and  calculated group -level random effects t -tests for motor imitation, \nobservation, and  their contrast (imitation>observation) for all groups.  \nResults: For both adults and children, the observation  and imitation t -maps each exhibit expected visual and temporal \ncortex activations, with additional motor cortex activation during imitation ( Fig. 1C). The ASD adult contrast map \nexhibits  stronger imitation response in right pre -frontal and temporal cortex - patterns not observed in NAC adults. \nDuring observation, while NAC and ASD children each show parietal activation, ASD children show enhanced motor \nand pre -motor activity.  \nConclusions : We established the feasibility of utilizing HD -DOT and CAMI to measure brain function underlying \nmotor imitation and observation in ASD and NAC children and adults and highlight differential cortical activity in \nautistic  participants in multiple regions. Our future directions include examining associations of neural signatures and \nimitation fidelity  with quantitative measures of ASD traits, IQ, and motor ability. Ongoing studies include extending \nHD-DOT and CAMI to ASD and NAC pre -school -aged children (currently n= 50).  \nReferences  \n[1] Nebel MB, et al.

    "Prefrontal Cort ical Activation During Cognitive Processing  \nin Aphasia: An Exploratory fNIRS Investigation\nBijoyaa Mohapatra  & Biraj Bhattarai\nLouisiana State University , Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA \nEmail: bmohap@lsu.edu\nAbstract:  Using fNIRS, this study explored prefrontal cortex (PFC) responses to cognitive tasks in \n10 persons with aphasia (PWA) and 10 age- and sex -matched healthy controls (HC) during working \nmemory  (WM) tasks of varying cognitive load and a problem -solving  task. PWA exhibited WM \ndeficits with slower reaction times and reduced accuracy.  PFC activation increased in the right \nlateral PFC for PWA and in the left lateral PFC for HC during high cognitive load conditions.  On \nthe problem -solving  task, distinct activation was observed  between the groups. Future research \nshould delve into the interplay among PFC activation, lesion location, and aphasia severity.  \nIntroduction:  Persons with aphasia (PWA) present with working memory (WM) deficit s that contribute  to their \nlanguage processing impairments1. Evidence from event -related neuroimaging studies have highlighted the role of \nlateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in maintenance and manipulation of information  during WM processing2. Only a few \naphasia studies have been reported using fNIRS.  Our objective is to understand the neural mechanisms underlying \nWM processes and shed light on the relationship between PFC activation and WM cognitive load in PWA.  \nMethods: A 16-channel fNIRS 2000 C Imager (Biopac, Inc)  was used to  measure hemodynamic responses  from  10 \nPWA and 10 age and sex matched neurotypical healthy controls (HC). Participants engaged in 1) a visual  n-back task \nof varying cognitive load - 1-back (low ) and 2 -back (high ) to assess WM , and 2) the Raven's Colored Progressive \nMatrices (RCPM) to evaluate non -verbal problem -solving and reasoning skills.  Behavioral performance accuracy  was \nrecorded . Oxygenation change (Hb -Oxy) was the  hemodynamic variable of interest  that was  recorded from the 16 \noptodes grouped into four separate quadrants, Q1: lateral left , Q2: central left , Q3: central right and Q4: lateral right . \nResults: n-back task - Both groups demonstrated significantly shorter average RT during the low load compared to \nhigh load condition (PWA: p = .02, HC: p = .01), alongside higher accuracy rates  \non low load condition , with statistical significance observed for both PWA ( p = \n.01) and HC ( p < .01). During low load condition, both groups displayed bilateral \nlateral PFC activations  and on the high load condition, HC exhibited increased \nactivation primarily in the left lateral PFC, whereas PWA demonstrated on the \nright lateral PFC. ( Figure 1). Between groups revealed that during the low load \ncondition, significant differences in Hb -Oxy were noted in Q2, Q3, and Q4 ( p < \n.001 for all) except Q1 ( p = .23)  quadrant , and during the high -load significant \ndifferences were observed  across all four quadrants ( p < .001). Within each \ngroup, significant differences were observed between both tasks on all quadrants \n(p <.001 for all comparisons). RCPM - Average RT was slower  for PWA (3818.9 \n± 475.96ms) than HC (2898.09 ± 346.02ms)  and p erformance accuracy was \ngreater for HC. PWA exhibited increased Hb-Oxy in bilateral lateral PFC \nregions, whereas HC showed on bilateral medial PFC regions  (Figure 2).  \nConclusion:  Performance differences on the n -back and RCPM tasks suggest \ncompromised problem -solving ability and WM function in PWA. This study \nrevealed a distinctive activation pattern in the right lateral PFC among PWA \nunder increased cognitive load, implying right hemisphere involvement to \ncompensate for left hemisphere lesions. Our finding aligns with previous \nstudie s indicating role of lateral PFC in WM processing as n-back requires \nactive  monitoring and manipulation of the incoming information, functions \nthat are primarily governed by the lateral PFC . On the  RCPM,  PWA demonstrated  decreased performance accuracy . \nand PWA rel ied more heavily on bilateral lateral PFC regions3. However, these findings are preliminary and warrant \nfurther investigation. Future fNIRS studies should correlate with lesion site, severity, and type  of aphasia, while \nexploring everyday language -based communication abilities  in aphasia . \nReferences:  \n1. Wright, H.

ECMO  \npump flow and vasoactive medications were titrated  to achieve OEF targets of 0.8, 0.7, or 0.6.  \nIntroduction:  We present a novel demonstration of brain -directed management of veno arterial extracorporeal \nmembrane oxygena tion (VA -ECMO) based on real -time feedback from non -invasive diffuse  optical \nneuro monitoring . VA-ECMO provides life -sustaining oxygenation and circulatory support  following cardiac failure . \nHowever, the brain is vulnerable to hypoxic -ischemic injury if oxy gen delivery is insufficient to meet metabolic \ndemands. Advanced diffuse optical neuromonitoring  modalities enable continuous quantification of cerebral blood \nflow, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and oxygen metabolism within a compact non -invasive foreh ead sensor. \nElevated cerebral OEF > 0.85 has been associated with ischemic injury. Maintaining cerebral OEF below this \nthreshold holds promise to prevent injury. Herein, we assess the feasibility of achieving and maintaining cerebral \nOEF levels of 0.8, 0.7 , and 0.6 during VA -ECMO support following prolonged cardiac arrest in pediatric swine.  \nMethods: Continuous optical monitoring of cerebral OEF was performed in a pediatric swine model of ECMO -\nassisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Following 8 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, animals (sus scrofa , \n8-12 kg) underwent 30 minutes of low -flow ECMO (20 ml/kg/min) with administration of epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) \nboluses ev ery four minutes to simulate CPR. Subsequently, the ECMO flow rate was increased to 70 -100 ml/kg/min \nto reflect clinical initiation of “full-flow” VA-ECMO. After 1 hour of full -flow ECMO, animals were randomized to \na OEF target of 0.8 (n=11), 0.7 (n=12), o r 0.6 (n=12) and brain -directed ECMO management was performed for 7 \nhours. OEF was re -assessed every 5 minutes and ECMO flow rate was adjusted between 50 -120 ml/kg/min to meet \nthe individual subject’s cerebral physiology. If the OEF target was not achieved  (±0.05 of target) with ECMO flow, \nvasoactive infusions were administered. Blood gas, electrolyte, and hematocrit levels, anticoagulation, and \nanesthesia were otherwise standardized across all subjects . \nResults: 71% (n=25/35) of animals \nachieved their cerebral OEF target \nwithin 1 hour of initiating brain -\ndirected ECMO management. Across \nall animals, respective OEF t argets \nwere maintained for 79% [57, 93] of the \n7-hour period (median [IQR] across \nanimals) .  \nConclusion:  Our results demonstrate \nthe feasibility and precision of real -time \noptimization of oxygen delivery to the \nbrain based on neurophysiologic \nfeedback from the  individual patient. \nThis represents a paradigm shift in VA -\nECMO management and presents new \nopportunities for early intervention to \nprevent neurological injury.   \nFigure 1: Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) values by OEF target \ngroup.

    "NinjaNIRS  2024: A Wearable High-Density fNIRS System  \nfor Whole -Head Imaging  \nBernhard B. Zimmermann, W. Joseph O’Brien, Laura Carlton, Sudan Duwadi, Johnathan \nMuhvich , Sreekanth Kura,  Jay Dubb, Meryem A. Yüce l, and David A. Boas  \nBoston Un iversity Neurophotonics Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, 02215   \nbzim@bu.edu  \nAbstract:  Impr oving on our previous systems, we have built NinjaNIRS 2024 , a modular, wearable \nwhole -head high -density fNIRS system that enables comprehensive study of brain function in \nnaturalistic environments . When configured for whole head coverage, the system features  56 source \nand 144 detector optodes with a 19mm spacing. Bench tests show that the system achieves low noise \nand high dynamic range , and i nitial tests on subjects performing a motor task show promising \nresults.  Our goal is to employ the system across multiple studies, enabling us to make additional \nrefinements .  \nIntroduction:  Wearable w hole-head high-density functional near -infrared spectroscopy (HD -fNIRS) offers an \nexciting opportunity to comprehensively study brain function in naturalistic environments. By providing coverage of \nthe entire cortical surface, whole -head HD -fNIRS enables holistic examination of neural activity and functional \nconnectivity across the cortex  while also affording high spatial resolution.  Improving on our previous systems , we \nhave further expanded the number of optodes and enhanced the multiplexing flexibility to allow for a greater frame \nrate. \nMethods: NinjaNIRS  2024 features a modular design. Each bundle of 8 optodes \nis attached to a plug -in card. The plug -in cards are connected to the control board \nvia 5 small backplanes (see Fig. 1 a). A maximum of 24 detector and 7 source \ncards are supported  by the current system . \nEach  detector card contains four dual channel analog to digital converters and a \nmicrocontroller, whereas each source card contains source selection transistor s, a \nvoltage controlled current source, as well as a microcontroller. On the control \nboard , a field programmable gate array (FPGA) runs the time -division \nmultiplexing sequence and aggregates data from all detector cards and auxiliary  \nchannels. This data is then forwarded  to an acquisition PC either via USB or via \nWiFi with the help of an on -board Raspberry Pi Zero single board computer.  \nOur detector optodes contain a 7.5mm2 active area silicon photodiode with \nintegrated ambient light filter as well as a low -noise , high-gain transimpedance \namplifier. Our source optodes contain a 735/850nm dual wavelength LED.  \nThe system is also compatible with NIRx NIRSport2 optode bundles. Using these \nbundles  as well as our 3D printed head cap (NinjaC ap) and our carrying harness \n(NinjaH arness ), we built a whole -head high -density system featuring 56 source \nand 144 detector optodes with a 19mm spacing (see Fig. 1 b). \nResults: Our own optodes achieve a noise equivalent power of 50fW/√Hz  at \n850nm  with an instantaneous dynamic range of 128dB. The source optodes \ndeliver an adjustable peak power between 0.5 and 75mW, adding another \npotential 43 dB of dynamic range . Using a combination of time -division and \nspatial multiplexing results in a frame rate of 9Hz. The whole -head system  has a \ntotal weight of 5.6kg including batteries, of which 0.91kg is on the head. Two \n12V/5Ah batteries allow for a run time of approximately 3.8 hours.  \nConclusion:  We h ave built three copies of our NinjaNIRS 2024  whole -head \nsystem. Initial tests on subjects performing a motor task show promising results. \nIn 2024, our goal is to employ the system across multiple studies, enabling us to \nmake additional refinements.  To enhance inclusivity, we will continue  improving  \nsignal quality to better accommodate subjects with the most challenging hair  and \nskin types .

    "Linear Model Estimation of Flow State Intensity using \nfNIRS and EEG Biomarkers  \n \nSaki Watanabe1, Tatsuya Suzuki1, Yumie Ono2 \n \n1Electrical Engineering Program, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan  \n2Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Japan  \nPresenting Author email address: ce231081 @meiji.ac.jp   \n \nAbstract:  The aim of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the sense of Flow, a  psychological state \nof focused engagement in an activity  that leads to enhanced enjoyment and performance.  We \nconducted simultaneous fNIRS and electroencephalography (EEG)  measurement s during cognitive \ntasks inducing varied intensity of Flow experience  and developed a linear regression model that \npredict s the time course of Flow intensity. The developed model could estimat e the time course of \nFlow intensity changes with a mean Pearson ’s correlation coefficient of 0.74 ± 0.0 5, suggesting its \npotential application to measure  the level  of engagement  and motivation with a workload . \n \nIntroduction:  Flow is a  psychological  state of complete immersion in an activity, characterized by a sense of control, \nenjoyment, satisfaction, and increased self -esteem. Functional brain imaging studies have shown that brain regions \ninvolved in cognitive control are activated during the Flow  experience  (Ulrich, M. et al. 2016) . However, the lack of \nan objective method for evaluating Flow intensity has hindered the use of Flow experience as an indicator of \nmaximizing the education and/or rehabilitation experiences. We investigated the changes in brain activity during \ncognitive tasks of three difficulty levels using fNIRS and EEG . We further developed a linear model to assess changes \nin Flow experience from the selected responses, with the aim of establishing an objective biomarker for evaluating \nFlow experience.  \nMethods: Thirteen healthy young adults participated in the experiment, during which they played the Tetris game at \nthree difficulty levels (easy, optimal, and hard) in a random order.  Four of them were measured twice on different \ndays, so data from a total of seventeen trials were analyzed.  The optical probes of the fNIRS system were placed over \nthe left prefrontal -parietal region in a 3 × 5 configuration.  EEG was recorded at six channels located over bilateral \nfrontal, mid -temporal, and central regions.  Participants used a visual analog scale (VAS) to continuously rate the time \ncourse changes in Flow intensity while reviewing a recorded video of themselves playing the game.  We extracted \noxygenated hemoglobin concentrations and relative amplitude changes of four frequency bands (į, ș, Į, and β)  as \nfNIRS and EEG biomarkers, respectively . Then, the measured time -series data were randomly divided into training \nand testing datasets at a ratio of 1:2 . We used a stepwise regression analysis to individually create a linear model that \nbest approximates the measured time course of Flow intensity  with six each of fNIRS and EEG biomarker s exhibiting \nstrong correlations with VAS scores . The accuracy of the predicted VAS scores from the  test data set was evaluated \nby the Pearson’s correlation analysis with the measured VAS scores . \nResults: Figure 1 shows a representative result displaying the measured VAS score s for Flow intensity and the \ncorresponding predicted VAS scores  obtained from the model. The linear model s were successfully derived for data \nfrom sixteen out of the seventeen trials . The linear regression model estimated by the combination of fNIRS and EEG \nhad excellent prediction performance, with a mean  correlation coefficient between the measured and predicted Flow \nintensities of 0.78 ± 0.0 3 (ranged from 0. 41 to 0.92). For the fNIRS biomarker alone, the coefficient was 0.79  ± 0.03, \nwhile for EEG alone it was  0.63 ± 0.03. \nConclusion:  Our results support the potential of fNIRS  and EEG  \nbiomarkers to objectively measure Flow intensity . In particular,  the \nfNIRS biomarker alone can represent Flow intensity with high \naccuracy, which we believe is due to a relatively low time resolution \nof fNIRS that avoided the overfitting . Our proposed method  for Flow \nstate prediction would be useful for assessing engagement and \nproviding a balanced workload in real -world cognitive task settings.  \nIn future studies, we would apply this method with brain activity \nduring cognitive tasks other than Tetris to verify the generalizability \nof the model.  \n  \nFigure 1: Representative Result of Flow \nintensity estimation from EEG and fNIRS \nsignals.  351 of 398",
    "Depression and impulsive decision making shows sex-specific \ninhibitory control: A fNIRS study\nAnkit Jha1, Varsha Singh2* \n1 – PhD candidate, UQ -IITD Academy of Research, IIT Delhi, New Delhi – 110016  \n2 – *Corresponding: Professor, Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Delhi, New Delhi – 110016  \nPresenting Author – Ankit Jha – Ankit.Jha@uqidar.iitd.ac.in  \nAlthough d epression is more prominent in women , men with depression show greater impulsivity \nand inclination for impulsivity and risk of self-harm.  Depression alters the dorsal network reducing \ninhibitory control . We examined o xy-hemoglobin response in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \nand impulsive decision -making in the Iowa Gambling Task (N = 49; Males=23) . Men with high \ndepression made poor decisions under risk and showed greater changes in rDLPFC ( ΔHbO) \ncompared to women with high depression. Depression in men might increase inhibitory demands \nand lead to impulsive decisions . \nIntroducti on: Males make safe, long-term decisions on the Iowa Gambling Task  –  a decision -making task. This \nadvantage is associated with better inhibitory  control , which is  attributed to higher  rDLPFC activity  in males than  \nfemales. Although depression and risky decision -making  are interlinked, whether sex-differences exist and if they are \naccounted for by right  lateralized dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC)  activity in risky decision -making  under  \nsubclinical  depression is unclear . This study uses oxy -hemoglobin  and deoxy -hemoglobin  response in rDLPFC to \nunderstand the effect of sex  and depression on  decision -making  under uncertainty versus risk phase in decision -\nmaking,  where healthy participants report  sub-clinical  depression scores . \nMethods:  Forty -nine healthy undergraduate students were recruited (26 females: 18 -25 yrs). They made decisions on \nthe Iowa Gambling Task and their hemodynamic response in the DLPFC was recorded using an 8x8 N IRSport system \n(NIRx LLC). C hannels with signal -to-noise ratio of 6.67 (CV -15%)  were included for analysis  (Homer3 v1.71.1) , data \ncorrected for saturation, followed by motion correction using SplineSG and Wavelet method. The hemodynamic \nresponse  function (HRF)  were calculated for blocks of 5 trials of the decision -making t ask (15s duration ). The peak \noxy-hemoglobin response (ΔHbO) and corresponding minimum ΔHbR in each block was obtained for each participant \nand was averaged to calculate average oxy-hemoglobin/deoxy -hemoglobin response over two phases (uncertainty and \nrisk phase – first 40 and last 40 trials of the game) . A mixed design RM-ANOV A was utilized to test the effects of sex,  \ndepression , and phases of IGT on peak oxy -hemoglobin response , lowest  deoxy -hemoglobin response, and HbO/HbR \nratio. \nResults: Our results show no main effect s of sex or depression severity  or phases of decision -making  but three -way \ninteraction s indicated that females with high depression , compared to males with high depression,  performed poorly \nin decision -making under  uncertainty but  performed  better under risk (p<0.05). Further, m ales showed increased \nchanges in  oxy-hemoglobin response  in rDLPFC in both uncertainty and risk phase  of decision -making . \nConclusion:  We acknowledge  low sample size is a limitation but our preliminary results  indicate that depression \naffects long term decision making under uncertainty in a sex -specific manner , higher rDLPFC  reflects greater \ninhibitory control demand and  could be responsible for poor decision making in males experiencing  uncertainty . These \nresults  indicate risky decision making in males experiencing depression might occur due to uncertainty, and \nuncertainty showed increased demand on  inhibitory control in male decision making under unce rtainty.   \nReferences: Singh, V ., Kumar, S., Jha, A., & Verma, R.

    "Functional Hybrid Speckle Contrast, Near Infrared Spectroscopy \nand Electroencephalogram  Sensing     \n \n1Nisan Ozanaand  2, Yumie Ono2, Mikie Nakabayashi2Tomoya Yamamoto, 1Vika Tarle \nGan 52900, Israel- Research Center, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Faculty of Engineering and The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain  1 \n1-1- Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University, 1 2  \nHigashi -Mita, Tama -ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 2148571, Japan  \nvika.tarle@biu.ac.il \nAbstract:  Brain -computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a means of communication for individuals with \ndisabilities. Due to the complexity of brain signals, significant differences between individuals, and \nlimitations of each measuring system, it's beneficial to simultane ously obtain hemodynamic and electrical \nsignals for assessing neurovascular coupling using cerebral blood flow (CBF), hemoglobin levels, and \nelectroencephalogram (EEG). In our study, we simultaneously measured all three methods  during two \ncognitive tasks, providing a window for studying neuro vascular coupling  that may improve  existing BCIs . \n \nIntroduction:   \nBrain -computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an approach for aiding individuals with severe \ndisabilities. Considering brain complexity, hybrid brain -sensing modalities are the best way \nfor accurate sensing. Among the array of hybrid BCIs explored, the combination of EEG and \nfNIRS technologies stands out. This enhancement is attributed to EEG's ra pid response \ncapabilities and fNIRS's consistent signal quality. However, a significant challenge arises from \nthe inherent limitations of fNIRS, notably its reliance on hemoglobin concentration changes \nthat serve as indirect and somewhat delayed markers of  neural activity. A more direct and \nsensitive measure  of brain perfusion is measuring relative Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF). \nAmong two existing techniques for measuring rCBF, Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) \n[1] and Speckle Contrast Optical S pectroscopy (SCOS)  [2, 3] , the lat ter shows a higher SNR \ndue to the use of  megapixel camera, thus , measuring a large number of speckles at once. This \nenables long source detector separations (SDS) with increased sensitivity to brain function.  \n  \nMethods and Preliminary Results:  \nWe built and design ed a SCOS system that w as measured together with the fNIRS and the \nEEG system. An EASYCAP was used to couple the fibers from all three systems - EEG, \nfNIRS , and SCOS as follows . The EEG system consists of six channels on  the prefrontal, \nmotor,  and visual cortices  (three channels on each side) . The fNIR S system consists  of six \nsources  and six detectors resulting in 22 channels, with a 3cm source -detector separation each. \nAll the channels were located o n one side of the head. The SCOS  system was located on the  \nopposite side from NIRS .  Two configurations  were used  (1) 4 channels using detector fibers \nof 400µm and (2) single fiber with 1000µm core diameter.  The detector used was a CMOS \nBasler 1440x1080 pixels camera , imaging the tip of the fiber with a single 25mm lens.

This research introduces a \nnovel approach using a few -shot learning algorithm for motor imagery cl assification based on \nmultimodal optical neuroimaging signals. The proposed method integrates embedding, attention, \nand relation modules to classify right -hand and left -hand motor imagery tasks using simultaneous \nmultimodal near infrared spectros copy (NIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Initially \ntrained on open -source NIRS -EEG datasets, the model is fine -tuned with optical signals to enhance \naccuracy.  \nIntroduction:   \nBrain -Computer Interface  (BCI) is at the forefront of medical innovation, offering great  potential in assisting \nindividuals with disabilities. Particularly, BCIs that leverage motor imagery classification can empower users by \nenabling control over prosthetic devices such as robotic arms . In our research , we present a new approach for motor \nimagery classification , using few -shot learning algorithms , utilizing optical signals from the brain.  \nMost works published in this domain have focused on motor imagery classification using electroencephalography \n(EEG) signals or established supervised learning methods  that necessitate extensive training data sets . Our approach \nseeks to enhance current techniques by reducing data dependency and accelerating the development of practical, real -\nworld BCIs.  \nMethods and Signal Processing : \nIn this study, we develop ed a few -shot learning classifier for motor imagery classification based on optical signals \nfrom the brain. To achieve this, we analyze  optical signals from subjects as they perform two tasks: right -hand motor \nimagery and left -hand motor imagery. Subjects are asked to imagine performing the motor action of finger tapping \nwith their respective hands . We use a few -shot classifier that includes three key modules: embedding, attention, and \nrelation.  Embedding Module: This module extracts  high-level features from the raw optical signal data.  Attention \nModule: This module focuses  on creating class representative features by discovering key featu res and highlighting \nessential patterns within the data.   Relation Module: This module establishes  relationships between the embedding \nfeatures to perform classification tasks.  Training and Fine -Tuning: Initially, the model trained using open -source EEG \ndata sets to learn general motor imagery patterns.

    "Investigating Motor Imagery with fNIRS-BCI in Low er \nLimb Movements \nHamza Shabbir Minhas1, Hammad Nazeer1, Noman Naseer1, Haroon Khan2, Peyman Mirtaheri2 \n1Department of Mechatronics and Biomed ical Engineering Air University Islamabad, Pakistan \n2Department of Mechanical, Electronic and Ch emical Engineering OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University Oslo, Norway  \nPresenting Author email address: hamza.minhas@students.au.edu.pk \nAbstract:  This study investigates the utility of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for \ndetecting cortical brain activity during motor imagery tasks. Ten participants performed knee flexion \nand extension imagery tasks while multi-channel continuous wave fNIRS system records the signals \nfrom the motor cortex. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) \nalgorithms were employed to classify the data for fNIRS-BCI applications. SVM outperformed \nLDA, achieving accuracies of 88.8% and 89.4% for two-feature and three-feature combinations. \nIncreased activation was observed in brain maps during knee flexion imagery.  \nIntroduction:  Motor imagery (MI) is the mental simulation of a movement without physically performing it. MI tasks \noffer non-muscular neurorehabilitation by stimulating neural circuits associated with movement [1]. This study \nfocused on knee joint movements using MI-based BCI, employing machine learning for accuracy. It represents a \nsignificant advancement in rehabilitation technology, leveraging brain signals to enhance mobility and paving the way \nfor further neurorehabilitation research. \nMethods: Data acquisition was done using NIRX NIRSport2 fNIRS system on 10 healthy participants.  The setup \nincluded 20 channels formed fr om 8 pairs of sources and detectors spaced 3cm apart according to the international \nEEG 10-20 system. The experimental paradigm involved motor imagery tasks related to extension and flexion of knee, \nfollowed by data preprocessing using the nirsLAB toolbox to analyze hemodynamic responses. Band-pass filter from \n0.01 Hz to 0.3 Hz was used to remove physiological interference. \nResults: Statistical features such as mean, peak, skewness, variance, and \nkurtosis extracted from ΔHbO were analyzed. The mean-variance-kurtosis \ncombination yielded notably higher classification accuracies compared to \nother combinations. The SVM classifier performed significantly better than \nLDA with an average classification accuracy of 89.5% and 84.16% for three-\nfeature and two-feature combinations respectively. Activation maps obtained \nusing Satori 2.0 revealed increased brain activation during knee flexion \ncompared to knee extension ash shown in Figure 1, indicating that flexion \nmovements require intricate coordination and involve multiple muscle groups. \nConclusion:  SVM classification showed higher accuracy, especially with \nthree-feature combinations. Results align with previous knowledge on brain \nregions involved in motor imagery, indicating greater activation during knee \nflexion tasks. This research opens avenues for fNIRS-BCI applications in \nrehabilitation, and assistive devices for muscular and neuromuscular diseases. \nFuture studies should integrate multimodal data, like fMRI or EEG, for a more \ncomprehensive understanding of brain activation across tasks.  \nReferences: \n[1] S.

While t he neural underpinnings of egocentric \nand allocentric spatial processes were  explored , no study investigated the cortical correlates \nunderlying switching  processes.  Through fNIRS, we measured  the cortical activity of switching  \n(Ego -Allo, Allo -Ego)  and non-switching  (Ego-Ego, Allo -Allo)  processes while participants were \nsubmitted to a  visuo -spatial memory task.  The results showed an activation of frontal regions during \nswitching vs non -switching condition. Interestingly, v isuo-spatial switching processes were \nsupported by a fronto -parietal -temporal network, which also crucially involves the temporo -parietal \njunction (TPJ).  \n \nIntroduction:  We represent the position of objects around us in egocentric ( body -object) or allocentric ( object -object ) \nreference frame s[1]. Moreover , we rely on both reference frames to respond to specific environmental needs and task \ndemands. For instance , when  using a fork , we encode its position relative to both our body and other objects  (e.g., the \nplate ). This example illustrates the cooperation ( i.e., switching) between egocentric and allocentric spatial reference \nframes that is needed  to accomplish several daily tasks [2,3]. While p revious neurofunctional studies have pointed out \nto fronto -parietal and temporo -parietal brain regions  underlying respectively egocentric and allocentric spatial \nprocesses [4,5 ], the cortical correlates underlying egocentric -allocentric switching processes remain unexplored . \n \nMethods: To fill this gap, the p articipants enrolled in this  study underwent to a custom -designed visuo -spatial memory \ntask while cortical activities underlying switching vs non -switching spatial processes were measured  with fNIRS.  \nParticipants  memorized triads of geometric objects , then provide d two consecutive judgments of relative dist ance \nabout the same triad  in non -switching and switching conditions . In the non -switching condition, both spatial judgments \nconsidered  the same reference frame : only  egocentric , only allocentric. In the switching condition, if the first judgment \nwas egocentric, the second one  was allocentric and vice versa.  In terms of expectations, if transient body -centered \nspatial representations stored in fronto -parietal regions are translated into object -centered spatial representations stored \nin temporo -parietal  regions  in a bidirectional way , then the concurrent activation of fronto -parieto -temporal regions \nshould emerge when comparing cortical activities in switching and non-switching conditions . \n \nResults: In the  non-switching condition s an activation of frontal regions was found for allocentric -based spatial \njudgments, and an activation of front o-parietal regions was found for egocentric -based ones . In switching conditions, \nan activation  of fronto -parietal -temporal regions was found, mainly in the switching condition from egocentric -to-\nallocentric reference frames . Finally , a significant activation of the temporo -parietal junction  was found  in switching \ncompared to non -switching conditions.  \n \nConclusion:  Overall, egocentric -allocentric visuo -spatial switching processes were supported rostro -caudally by a \nfronto -parieto -temporal activation  with a crucial involve ment of the temporo -parietal junction.  \n \n1.Paillard, J.

    "Use fNIRS Hyperscanning  to Investigate the Effect of Risk \nPreference on Dyadic Decision  \n \nJing Wen1,2 †,Tianya Hou1†,Qianlan Yin1,Danni Yang1,Shuo Chen1,Ying Liu1,Xiaoqin Shao1,Wei Dong1* \n \n1Faculty of Psychology, Navel Medical University, Shanghai  200000 , Chin a  \n2Department of Medical Psychology, PLA No. 905 Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai 200050, China  \nPresenting Author email address:  w990329@163.com   \n \nAbstract:   Used fNIRS hyperscanning  to investigate the effect of risk preference on dyadic decision. \nFirstly , used sequential decision task to measure subjects' risk preferences as baseline, and then \npaired subjects into “risk-risk”, “risk-conservative ”, and “conservative -conservative” groups to per-\nform a self -designed  dyadic version of sequential risk taking task  with fNIRS hyperscanning. Ulti-\nmately, we found that the “ risk-risk” group got the most rewards , had the fewest number of disa-\ngreements in the experiment, and showed  greater interpe rsonal brain synchronization . In conclusion , \nthe “ risk-risk” group had a higher quality of risky decision making in the risk -seeking context.  \n \nIntroduction:  Decision -making is closely related to people's lives, and its quality plays a crucial role in the positive \ndevelopment of individuals and groups. The number of decision -makers is a major influencing factor of the quality of \ndecision -making. As decision -making tasks and environments become more complex, it may be difficult for a single \nperson to fully consider the decision situation, exposing more risk. Group decision making can effectively avoid the \ndisadvanta ges of single person decision making . Dyadic risky decision making  is the more common group decision \nmaking mode, which can be a good entry point for studying group decision -making.  Risk preference refers to the \nbasic reaction and psychological tendency of individuals towards risk, which can reflect the attitude of individuals \nwhen facing risky decisions and can better predict individual risky decision behavior. The investigation of t he differ-\nences in cooperative behaviors of people with different risk preferences in dyadic risky decision making  and the  related \nneural mechanisms can help to deeply analyze the real motives of cooperative behaviors in dyadic  risky decision \nmaking  and provide objective basis and scientific support for related theories.  \n \nMethods: A total of 168 participants were recruited (62 males and 106 females; mean age  21.26 years, s.d. = 1.70). \nAll subjects reported normal or corrected -to-normal vision and were right -handed . Firstly, sequential decision task1 to \nmeasure subjects' risk preferences as baseline, and then paired subjects into “ risk-risk”, “risk -conservative”, and “con-\nservative -conservative” groups to perform a self -designed two -person sequential decision task with fNIRS hyperscan-\nning. Behavioral data were statistically an alyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0, and fNIRS data were analyzed using \nMatlabR2013b.  \n \nResults: In dyadic decision preferences, “risk-risk” group showed risk -taking preferences and “conservative -con-\nservative”  group showed risk -averse preferences.  In dyadic decision rewards , “risk-risk” group got the highest rewards  \nand “conservative -conservative”  got the lowest rewards . In dyadic decision process, “risk-risk” group had the fewest \nnumber of disagreements.  At the individual level, the risk takers were more sensitive to the gain outcome, showing \nstronger activation of the central dlPFC brain area, left dlPFC, and OFC brain area; the conservatives were more \nsensitive to the loss outcome, showing stronger activ ation of the left dlPFC brain area and OFC brain area.  At the \ngroup  level, “risk-risk” group showed stronger inter -brain synchronization, and “risk-conservative ” group had higher \ninter-brain synchronization for loss outcomes than  that for gain outcomes.  \n \nConclusion:  In dyadic decision , “risk-risk” group  was more influenced by monetary rewards, which  was manifested \nas risk -seeking, and “conservative -conservative”  group  was more influenced by monetary losses, which was mani-\nfested as risk avoidance. Combining the results of behavioral and fNIRS hyperscanning studies, this study concluded \nthat the “ risk-risk” group  had higher quality risky decisions in risk -seeking situations.  \n \n1.Büchel, C., Brassen, S., Yacubian, J., Kalisch, R., & Sommer, T.

    "Improvements in fNIRS -BCI Classification through \nIntegrated Contextual Gate Networks   \nJamila Akhter, Noman  Naseer, Hammad Nazeer  \n \nDepartment of Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering, Air University, Islamabad  \njamila.akhter@mail.au.edu.pk , noman.naseer@mail.au.edu.pk , hammad@mail.au.edu.pk  \n  \nAbstract:  Brain -computer interface (BCI) systems include signal acquisition, preprocessing, \nfeature extraction, classification, and an application phase. This study employs z -score \nnormalization and an Integrated Contextual Gate Network (ICGN) algorithm to enhance  fNIRS -\nbased BCIs classification accuracy. Results demonstrate ICGN's superiority over long short -term \nmemory (LSTM) and bidirectional  long short -term memory (Bi -LSTM) algorithms, achieving a \nclassification accuracy of 91.23% ± 1.60%. Additionally, the algorithm's efficiency extends to two -\nclass as well as three -class datasets, showcasing its pot ential for real -time fNIRS -BCI applications.  \n \nIntroduction:  BCI systems typically involve several stages, including acquiring signals from the brain, preprocessing \nthese signals, extracting relevant features, classifying them, and finally applying the results to control external devices. \nIn fNIRS -based BCI systems,  deep learning algorithms are employed to improve classification accuracy by feature \nextraction based on patterns within signals. These deep learning (DL) networks autonomously identify intricate \npatterns embedded within the dataset, enabling more accurate  classification of the brain signals.  \n \nMethods: This study implements z -score normalization on fNIRS data and introduces the ICGN algorithm to improve \nclassification accuracy. The ICGN algorithm extracts features from the filtered and normalized data and generates \npatterns using information from precedi ng ICGN cells in the deep learning network. Consequently, classification is \nbased on similar patterns generated within the dataset. The algorithm is then tested on a two -class motor activity \ndataset involving hand -gripping tasks from twenty healthy partici pants.  \n \nResults: The application of z -score normalization to the fNIRS dataset, coupled with the implementation of the ICGN \nalgorithm, yielded promising results. Notably, the proposed algorithm achieved a classification accuracy of 91.23 ± \n1.60% on a two -class hand -gripping motor activity dataset, outperforming both the LSTM and Bi -LSTM algorithms \nwith accuracies of 84.89 ± 3.91% and 88.8 2 ± 1.96%, respectively. Additionally, the  computational time was \nsignificantly reduced, showcasing the efficiency of the proposed approach. Moreover, the ICGN algorithm \ndemonstrated its versatility by achieving competitive results on a three -class dataset consisting of right -hand finger \ntapping, left-hand finger tapping, and dominant foot tapping tasks.  \n \nConclusion:  These results highlight the potential of z-score normalization and deep learning methodologies, \nparticularly the ICGN algorithm, in advancing the capabilities of fNIRS -based BCI systems for intuitive \ncommunication and control applications.  \n \n359 of 398",
    "Analysis of Word Processing in a Child with Down's Syndrome: An \nfNIRS-based Case Study \nAndaleeb Sahar1, Huma Batool1, Hammad Nazeer2, Lauren Franklin1 \n1Department of English, Air University, Islama bad \n2Department of Mechatronics  and Biomedical Engineering , Air University, Islamabad  \nanna.sahar000@gmail.com , huma.batool@students.au.edu.pk , hammad@mail.au.edu.pk , lauren.franklin@mail.au.edu.pk   \nAbstract:  Word processing plays a vital role in developing language  and communication skills. Yet, the \nunderstanding of how individuals with Down's Syndrome (DS) process words is not thoroughly examined  at the \nneural level . This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by using functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS ) \nthrough lexical tasks . Specifically, it explores how a child with DS processes nouns and verbs, aiming to uncover \nthe neural mechanisms behind word processing. Initial results indicate th e activation of  Frontal and Temporal \nlobes with nouns prompt ing sharp neural responses, whereas verbs trigger extended cognitive engagement.  \nIntroduction:  Word processing is a complex cognitive process that plays a crucial role in language acquisition, communication, \nand learning. However, individuals with Down's Synd rome often display specific cognitive and language challenges, including \ndifficulties in  morphosyntactic  processing . fNIRS can reveal important information about the activation of specific neural regions \nand differences in neural activation patterns during  language -specific  cognitive activities. Despite its potential, there is a lack of \nresearch examining word processing in people with Down's Syndrome using  fNIRS.  \nMethods: The current  single -participant  case study investigate s word processing in a child wi th Down ’s syndrome, at a one-word \nlanguage level . Lexical tasks delivered through PsychoPy presented both visual and auditory stimuli to assess noun and verb \nprocessing.  Data was collected through  fNIRS  with the cap covering the participant ’s left hemisphere , followed by analysis in \nSA TORI and Nirxlab . Activation maps were analyzed to identify brain regions engaged during the processing of nouns and verbs  \n(Figures 1 and 2)  and time series plots were gene rated  for Block and ROI channel averaging, to examine  neural activation patterns \nassociated with nouns and verbs.  \nResults: Preliminary findings indicate that Brodmann areas 6, 42 , and 47, located in the temporal and frontal lobes , were \npredominantly active during noun processing. For verb processing, 45, 46 , and 47  situated in the frontal lobe, showed the highest \nactivity  as shown in Table 1 . Furthermore, t he noun processing graph s exhibit a sharp, pronounced peak, indicating inte nse and brief \nneural activity  (where most of the nouns were  processed more quickly and at an earlier stage  of processing ). In contrast,  the verb \nprocessing graph s display a more sustained and gradual increase, suggesting prolonged engagement .  \nConclusion:  This fNIRS -based study on a child with Down's Syndrome highlights distinct neural activation for nouns and verbs, \nrevealing pronounced activity in the temporal and frontal lobes. However, the limited generalizability of this study highlights the \nneed for further research involving a broader participant base or  mental  age-matched comparison with  typically developing children. \nThis approach would help validate and expand upon the initial findings . \n  \nBlock Noun Condition  Verb Condition  Channels  Brodmann \nAreas Lobe Channels  Brodmann \nAreas Lobe Unrelated  Distractors  9 47  Frontal 7 47 Frontal Semantic  Distractors  10 42 Temporal  9, \n12 47, \n45 Frontal Phonological Distractors  5 42 Temporal  10, \n7 42, \n47 Temporal  \nFrontal Unrelated + Semantic \nDistractors  9, \n13 47,  \n6 Frontal 12 45 Frontal Semantic + Phonological \nDistractors  17 6 Frontal 21 47 Frontal Unrelated + Phonological \nDistractors  8, 9, \n12 42, 47,  45 Temporal  \nFrontal 22 46 Frontal Unrelated + Semantic + \nPhonological Distractors  17 6 Frontal 20 46 Frontal \nFig. 1.

    "Channel Selection using Ant Colony Optimization for fNIRS \nBased BCI \nMuhammad Arqum Razzaq*, **, Hammad Nazeer*, Noman Naseer*\n*Department of Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering, Air University, Islamabad \n**Department of Mechatronics Engineering, University of Chakwal, Chakwal \nPresenting Author email address: arqum.razzaq@uoc.edu.pk \nAbstract:  The availability of fast and accurate fNIRS signals is crucial for the rehabilitation of \ndisabled individuals. Signal processing and classification can be expedited and enhanced in accuracy \nby selecting channels with higher activation levels. In this study, we apply a meta-heuristic \nalgorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to fNIRS signals for channel selection. We compare \nthe results with state-of-the-art methods such as the t-value and z-score methods. Our findings \ndemonstrate that utilizing ACO for channel selection can significantly improve classifier accuracy.  \nIntroduction:  Accurate acquisition and classification of fNIRS signals are important for improving the response of \nBrain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been employed \nto enhance the accuracy of fNIRS signal classification. It has been observed that selecting more activated channels \ncan expedite and improve the accuracy of fNIRS signal processing. It has been observed that the fNIRS signal \nprocessing can be fast and more accurate if more activated channels are selected. This concept was first introduced by \nSantosa et al. [1] using the t-value method, where channels were selected based on t-value > t-critical. Nazeer et al. \n[2] further refined this idea by selecting channels with z-scores > 0.\nMethods: We utilized an open-access fNIRS dataset of unilateral finger and foot tapping [3], comprising three classes: \nleft finger tapping, right finger tapping, and foot tapping. The average of 25 trials per class was taken. A Butterworth \nfilter with a frequency range of 0.01 to 0.2 Hz was applied to remove noise. In the ACO method, we computed the \npheromone value for each channel, representing its accuracy score. Channels with pheromone values greater than the \naverage pheromone value after multiple iterations were selected; otherwise, they were discarded. We compared the \naccuracy of ACO with existing methods such as t-value and z-score methods.  \nResults: ACO successfully improved classifier accuracy by selecting channels. Our results indicated a 13% overall \nimprovement in average accuracy for the three-class data and a 10% improvement for the two-class data when using \nACO for channel selection. In the three-class dataset, 6-12 channels were selected, while 5-12 channels were selected \nin the two-class dataset. The p-value of ACO for the selected channels in the three-class dataset with all channels was \n<0.05, confirming the research hypothesis. Figures 1 and 2 present comparative results.  \n  Figure 1.  Accuracies comparison for 3 class dataset     Figure 2. Accuracies comparison 2 class dataset  \nConclusion:  ACO effectively selects channels, thereby enhancing classifier accuracy. Future research could explore \nadditional features such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, etc., and validate the results with other available \ndatasets. \nReferences  \n1.

In this study we examined the existence of both neuropsychological and \nbrain haemodynamic  differences  using fNIRS  between patients and control subjects. As expected, beyond \nthe observed lower scores in working memory tests , patients with fibromyalgia presented lower functional \nactivity in prefrontal sites  when performing and N-back t ask. Understanding the relationship between \ncognitive performance and brain activity may prove crucial for the development of future intervention tools \nbetter adapted to these patients.  \n \nIntroduction : Patients with fibromyalgia are characterized by presenting, together with persistent chronic pain, an impairment \nin cognitive processes such as working memory, which seems to be supported by changes in the functional activity of brain \nregions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Seo et al., 2012 ). While the presence of poor working memory performance \nhas been extensively studied in fibromyalgia, there are still few studies exploring functional changes related to working \nmemory, where th e use of  fNIRS may provide a novel and more accessible approach to address this knowledge gap.  The aim \nof the present study was to explore the underlying neural correlates of working memory in fibromyalgia through fNIRS.  \n \nMethods : Thirty -two fibromyalgia patients and thirty -three control participants took part in the investigation. Working \nmemory was measured using selected neuropsychological subtests of the W AIS -IV and WMS -III and by means an n -back task \nwith three different load levels (n -back 0, 1 and 2 ) using the E-Prime  2.0 software  (Figure 1) .

    "Exploring Prefrontal Cortex Activity and Turning Dynamics \nin Parkinson’s Freezing of Gait \n \nAnjanibhargavi Ragothaman, William Liu, Carla Silva-Batista, Patricia Carlson-Kuhta, \nGraham Harker, Jacqueline Ellison, Fay B. Horak, Martina Mancini \n \nDepartment of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Road, Portland, Oregon, USA   \nragotham@ohsu.edu  \n \nAbstract: Freezing of gait (FoG),  characterized by sudden cessation  of stepping , poses mobility \nchallenges  in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Turning is the most important t rigger  for F oG. Frontal \nexecutive dysfunction has been implicated in FOG pathophysiology  and associated with turning \nimpairments.  This study investigates FoG  during 360º turning tasks, exploring prefrontal cortex \n(PFC) activit y in 54 freezers , ON-Levodopa. Freezers showed fewer turns, longer turn duration s, \nand heightened PFC activity. A significant interaction between freezer status and PFC activity on \nturns suggests compensatory PFC use in freezers. Understanding these dynamics sheds light on \ncompensatory  mechanisms  of PFC  in FoG , potentially informing future interventions.  \n \nIntroduction:  FoG in PD involves inability to continue stepping , especially during turning, increasing fall risk . \nTurning is the most important trigger for F oG. Levodopa can alleviate FoG episodes but doesn't improve  balance or \ncognitive issues . Frontal executive dysfunction has been implicated in FOG pathophysiology and associated with \nturning impairments.  Freezers have  higher PFC activity during  turning compared to walking  [1]. However, the specific \nrelationship between PFC activity and turning behavior during ON-Levodopa remains unclear . This study aimed to \ninvestigate turning and PFC activity differences between individuals with and without F oG (FOG/nFOG) during 360º \nturning tasks. Furthermore, we sought to elucidate any potential interactions between freezer status and PFC activity \nin influencing the execution of turning movements, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of FOG  in PD. \nWe hypothesize that freezers would have higher PFC activity and more impaired turning compared to non -freezers.  \n \nMethods: In this ongoing study, 54 individuals with idiopathic PD (Mean : age 67.5 ±6, disease duration 9.9 ±6 years, \nMDS -UPDRS III 34.4 ±11, MoCA 26.6±2) were included and tested while On Levodopa. Objective turning metrics \nwere measured during 1 -minute 360º turning  in place  using inertial sensors worn on head, sternum, lumbar, bilateral \nwrists and feet. PFC activity was measured using a continuous wave, portable fNIRS system with 50 Hz sampling \nfrequency. The turning task included 20 s quiet stance, 60 s turning (alternating  left-right directions ) and 10 s quiet \nstance. We derived the following metrics for turning: number of turns, and mean of turn -duration, -peak velocity and \n-jerk. Continuous data were normalized when they were not normally distributed. Linear mixed -model s were  \ncomputed for identifying group differences (FOG vs nFOG) and association between fNIRS and turning metrics. \nModels were run with and without MDS -UPDRS Part III as a covariate to account for disease severity.  \n \nResults: Freezers exhibit reduced number of turns (p=0.03), longer turn duration (p=0.03), and heightened PFC \nactivity (p=0.04) during 360º turns compared to non -freezers. However, when disease severity was added as a \ncovariate, the differences were attenuated. There is a significant interaction between freezer status and mean \noxygenation on number of turns (with and without covariate, p=0.04).   \n \nConclusion:  Our findings suggest that the observed group differences between freezers and non -freezers, are likely \ninfluenced by disease severity. Interestingly, the significant interaction observed between freezer status and mean \noxygenation on number of turns implie s that freezers use higher PFC with more number of turns while non -freezers \nshow the inverse, indicating a compensatory effect of PFC in freezers.  \n \n1.

Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is one of the BCI data acquisition  \ntechnique . In this work, fNIRS data  for word generation tasks  is represented as three dimensions, \nGaussian and Wavelet transformation s are applied on data to create a pool of the data to mimicking \nthe top view of the BCI cap having sources and detectors. This data has rich amount of spatial and \ntemporal features that is classified using 3D CNN model.  Each op tode value is linked with their \nneighbor’s empty spaces that  increase the signal strength  and improved  accuracy up to  3%. \nIntroduction:  In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and increased reliance on cognitive tasks, \nunderstanding and assessing mental workload is crucial . Accurately detecting mental workload is essential for \noptimizing task performance. Word generation tasks has a rich source of cognitive mental workload data, where \nindividuals generate words in response to cues.  A publicly available dataset  [1] of word generation task is used in [2] \nwith 3 sec windowing and achieve d 82% and 89% accuracy with 2D CNN and SVM models.  This study aims to \ndevelop robust models for classifying mental workload  using advanced deep learning and data analysis techniques . \nThe mental workload is created by word generation task. In this research, 5 samples were combined to make 3D \nspatiotemporal representation along with 3D CNN to classify.  \nMethods: Each individual  have different brain signals  recorded using  fNIRS, 26 participant s data  [1] is used.

Twenty -one participants had their prefrontal brain \nsignals recorded during both music and non -music sessions. The findings indicate that thirteen  \nsubjects had increased concentration, as measured by SART performan ce and brain activation, wh ile \neight  subjects had decreased  concentration. In both conditions , statistica l analysis verified \nsignificant difference in activation  (p < 0.05). The overall result validates the hypothesis that brain \nconcentration levels are increased while listening to music than without music.  \n \nIntroduction:  This study uses f NIRS -BCI technology with the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) to \ninvestigate how music affects conc entration levels. There is a little  evidence of music's cognitive effects, but more \nresearch is needed to fully understand how music affects brain concentration  in particular. The goal is to learn more \nabout the brain mechanisms that underlie music's ability to improve concentration through  an analysis of prefrontal \ncortex activity.  \n \nMethods: Twenty -one subjects, ages 20 to 42, had f NIRS data collected using a  NIRX NIRS port2  device (10 males  \nand 11 females ). For five minutes , the SART test ran  for both conditions with simul taneous data collection on fNIRS  \ndevice . It was divided into two phases  a 30s initial and final rest with tasks period of 2mins for both  conditions one \ntrial for each with a rest period of 30s between both tasks . Signals were processed by MATLAB, and SART results \nwere examined by PsyToolkit  [1]. Machine learning algorithms were applied to confirm the difference in signals with \nand without music.  \n \nResults: Thirteen individuals in the SART test showed improved concentration levels when lis tening to music, as \nseen by  the average reaction time for without music 218.0778 ms with 89.64 % accuracy  and for with music reaction \ntime 214.8534 ms and an accuracy of 91.02 % The prefrontal cortex of these i ndividuals exhibited correspondingly \nhigher activation, according to brain signal analysis. The significance of these results was validated by statistical \nanalysis (p < 0.05).  \n \nConclusion:  The results show that listening to music \nimproves concentration levels as seen by the faster \nreaction times and higher accuracy. The prefrontal \ncortex of these individuals exhibited correspondingly \nhigher activation, according to brain signal analysis.  \n \nReference  \n[1] G.

    "Effects of rTMS and C ue Stimuli on Resting-State  \nFunctional Connectivity in Methamphetamine-Dependent  \nIndividuals  \nWenyao Zheng , Yun-Hsuan Chen*, Ziyi Zeng , Xurong Gao, and Mohamad Sawan* \nCenBRAIN Neurotech Center of Excellence, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou 3100 30, China  \nPresenting Author email address: zhengwenya o@westlake.edu.cn (W.Z.)  \n*Correspondence  authors  \nAbstract:  This research investigated  repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment \nand drug -related cue stimuli’s effect  on orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) -related resting -state functional \nconnectivity (rsFC) in Methamphetamine (METH) -dependent individuals. Using fNIRS signals \nfrom healthy and METH -dependent individuals, pre - and post -rTMS treatment, METH -dependent \nindividuals initially showed  hyperexcitability, alleviated  by rTMS. Healthy participants exhibited  \nincreased rsFC post -stimuli, contrasting with decreased connectivity in METH -dependent individ-\nuals, indicating inadequate craving suppression. Post -treatment, hyperexcitability decreased , with \nsome connections resembling healthy patterns, suggesting rTMS efficacy in restoring inhibition un-\nder drug -related stimuli. These findings deepen  understand ing of  addiction -related neural mecha-\nnisms and identify  biomarkers for addiction discrimination and intervention efficacy assessment.  \nIntroduction:  The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC ) plays a crucial role in drug addiction. Research has found that the OFC \nof METH -dependent individuals is hyperexcitable, but it can be improved through various interventions.  Resting-state \nfunctional connectivity (rsFC ) is an extensively studied topic for investigating neural pathway changes. This study \nexpects to explore further the effects of rTMS and cue stimuli on OFC -related rsFC, exploring related neural pathways \nand mechanisms.  \nMethods: The fNIRS signal s of 16 healthy control participants (HC) and 16 METH -dependent individuals  were rec-\norded . HC completed one full experiment, while addicted participants completed two experiments, pre - and post -10-\nday rTMS treatment  (label led as MBT and MAT) . Each experiment comprised two sessions of 10 -minute eye -closed \nresting states, during which was a 15 -minute drug -related cue stimuli stage. Resting state analysis utilized the middle \n8 minutes of each session to mitigate movement and fatigue effects. Functional connectivity  was assessed using Pear-\nson Correlation among 8 regions of interest (ROIs). Paired t -tests were used for within -group comparisons, while \nanalysis of variance  was employed for between -group comparisons.  \nResults: As shown in the Table and Figure, MBT  exhibited relatively higher rsFC between ROIs compared to the \nother groups, indicative of OFC hyperexcitability associated with the aberrant reward processing, but it can be im-\nproved by rTMS treatment. Following stimuli, HC  demonstrated increased rsFC, notably between R -OFC and L -\nVLPFC. Conversely, MBT showed several decreased connectivity post -stimuli, particularly between R -OFC and \nDLPFC, suggesting inadequate drug craving suppression. After treatment, the hyperexcitability  in brain regions of \nMAT  was alleviated, with overall connectivity lower  than MBT . Notably, some connections are increasing post -stim-\nuli, resembling HC patterns, especially between L -OFC and R -VLPFC, L -OFC and R -OFC, and R -OFC and L -\nVLPFC, suggesting rTMS efficacy in restor-\ning inhibition of VLPFC processing cessation \nunder drug cue stimuli.  \nConclusion:  We found out  the effects of \nrTMS treatment and cue stimuli on the rsFC \nin METH -dependent individuals, demonstrat-\ning drug-induced  hyperexcitability and im-\npaired  inhibitory function in connectivity.

This study \nexplores the relationship between  readi ng speed and comprehension by  underlying neural mechanisms using \nfunctional near -infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS).  Employing  block  method,  20 MPhil  English  students  (10 M; 10 F)  \nparticipated  in the reading  tasks.  Initial  findings  reveal  distinct activation patterns in the left hemisphere during reading \ntasks, highlighting the diverse cognitive functions  supported by different cortical regions. These findings offer insights \ninto the neural activation patterns during  reading comprehension  and correlation between reading speed and \ncomprehension . \nIntroduction: Reading, essential for extracting meaning from text, encompasses decoding and comprehension. It is vital in education  \nand cognitive development, yet proficiency v aries. Studies show conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between reading speed  \nand comprehension.  This research  bridges  this gap by exploring  the neural  correlates  of reading  speed  and comprehension  among  English  \nlanguage  learners  using  fNIRS.  \nMethods: This study  uses fNIRS  to investigate  the neural  basis  of reading  comprehension  and speed  among  English  language  learners.  \nTwenty MPhil English students  (ages: 20 -30), participated in reading task s as part of the study. Reading tasks  delivered  through  \nPsychoPy  presented  both reading  passages  and multiple -choice  questions  to assess  reading  speed  and comprehension. Data was  obtained \nusing fNIRS technology, with a cap placed on the participant's left hemisphere, and later analyzed  using Nirxlab sof tware. Activation \nmaps were analyzed to identify brain regions engaged during the processing of reading tasks and  time series plots were generated for \nBlock and ROI channel averaging, to examine neural activation patterns associated with reading  speed and comprehension.  The block \nparadigm (Fig. 1) was followed for data collection, expected to last 8 minutes and 40 seconds,  with a 20-second rest  interval  followed \nby 60 seconds  of reading  activity.  \n \n \nFig.1.

The system shows significant results  for artificial neural \nnetwork  (ANN) , applied after pre -processing the data, than the traditional  machine learning (ML) \ntechniques for fNIRS based brain -computer interface (BCI).  The ANN achieves average accuracy \nof 85% and 76% for binary -class and multi -class  respectively, while traditional ML techniques can \nget 68 % and 55% . The ANN outperforms the ML techniques in terms of robustness and accuracy.  \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising neuroimaging modality for \nstudying brain function in various cognitive and motor tasks. fNIRS enables non -invasive monitoring of brain activity \nwith high spatial as well as temporal resolution  by measuring the changes in he modynamics . Unilateral finger tapping \ngives insight to the motor control mechanism to develop BCI . Currently, ANN has gained much success in fNIRS \nbased motor control tasks due to its ability to capture complex  nonlinear relationships in the data. As ANN follows \nthe biological  neural networks , it offer s flexibility for handling high -dimensional data  and extracting useful features \nfor motor tasks . The ANN shows significant results in comparison to the tradition ML techniques when used for mo tor \ntasks  (focused on motor cortex ) instead of mental  arithmetic  or counting  (targeting prefrontal cortex )[1]. Accurate \nclassification of tasks from fNIRS signals holds significant implications for diagnosing motor disorders, monitoring \nneurorehabilitation progress, and designing adaptive BCI systems . \nMethods: The data set  contains 30 subjects  (17 male)  with 25 sessions  for each class  (i.e. right -hand , left-hand  finger \ntapping  and feet tapping)  having introductory, task and rest phase in each recording session  [2].

Using picture -naming, assessed through fNIRS modality, this study \nexplores prefrontal brain activations amongst neurotypical multilinguals fro m four provinces of \nPakistan. 12 right -handed participants utilized native language (Punjabi, Pushto, Sindhi or Balochi), \nfirst language (Urdu) and second language (English) distinctively in the experiment. Imaging results \ndemonstrate significant  activation of the right prefrontal cortex along with left laterality. Heavier \ncognitive load appeared when using English in comparison to other language(s). It conclude s right \ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex play a vital role in language processing.  \n \nIntroduction:  Language production is considered left lateralized (Rogers, 2021). Studies done on patients with \ndamage to the left hemisphere point towards to the brain’s evolved plasticity of the brain , where  the right hemisphere \ntook the load of language processing. This evidence establishes a need to explore peripheral brain activation in normal \nfunctioning adults too. Moreover, knowing how the brain inhibits and processes languages for a multilingual speaker \nis an underexplored phenomenon  (Jones et al., 2012) , which the present study intends to explore.   \n \nMethods: The study utilizes 12 neurotypical multilingual speakers and assesses their brain activity using the \nNIRSport2 fNIRS system, developed by NIRX Medical Technologies®.  Utilizing 6 trials through block design for \neach participant, the task of picture naming for  each participants’  three languages was used to acquire data. This \ninhibition causes the participants to restrict their language processing towards one language  at a time  (See Figure 1) . \n \nResults: After data preprocessing through NIRSlab  and channel selection through t-value method, it was found out \nthat there were significant differences in activation and English language activated the most channels (14/20) . The \nresults reveal a heavy dependency on the right prefrontal cortex which covers the major Brodmann areas of BA8, \nBA9, BA10, and BA46.   \n \nConclusion:  In the present study, fNIRS was utilized for picture naming task, created specifically for varied native \nlanguages of the country . Picture naming causing language processing is known to involve the brain’s language areas \nas it involves word production (Moriai -Izawa et al., 2012). The cortical activations of the left hemisphere showed \nconsistency with previous studies however, the st udy was able to deduce newer activation patterns in the right \nhemispheric region of the prefrontal cortex.  \n \n \nFigure  1: Illustration of Experimental Paradigm  \nReferences : \n1.

Results: the child showed physiological responses in the temporal cortex with no \nsignificant difference between the hemispheres.  \n \nIntroduction:  The Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurement is a non-invasive cortical \nneuroimaging technology that can be applied in cases of bimodal hearing, that is, when the individual is a user of an \nHearing Aids (HA) and a Cochlear Implant (CI) 1. It is expected that by combining the use of fNIRS with the study \nof bimodal hearing, it will be possible to contribute to scientific advancement in the understanding of neural \nmechanisms in bimodality, with auxiliary knowledge for clinical practice, in particular, in objectively verifying \ndevelopment markers. and in behavioral decisions regarding indications of bilateral implantation. In view of this, the \nobjective of the present study was to characterize the cortical responses obtained by fNIRS and verify their association \nwith hearing and language performance in the case study of a child with a chronological age of eight years and a \nhearing age of five years and two months, user of a CI in the Left Ear and hearing aids in the Right Ear undergoing \nauditory rehabilitation for five years. \nMethods: Study approved by the Research Ethics Committee under opinion number 5,989,435. Clinical protocols \nwere applied to characterize auditory-linguistic performance and fNIRS on the NIRXSport1 equipment with speech \nstimuli /ba/ and /da/ from Brazilian native Portuguese, male speaker, recorded (44.1 Hz, 16 bits, 300ms each constant \n-vowel), in a free field, with electronic devices turned on, in a habituation and dishabituation paradigm to identify \nauditory detection and discrimination. Eight emission and detection optodes forming 20 channels were positioned in \nthe temporal region of both cerebral hemispheres. She remained seated passively and vigilantly. To analyze the data, \nthe MNE and MNE-NIRS toolboxes were used with the help of Spyder 2. The average per channel, ROI, and condition \nwere exported for analysis. The clinical protocols were analyzed descriptively. \nResults: The child exhibited auditory and language development within developmental milestones and presented \nphysiological responses in the temporal cortex, however, without significant differences between the hemispheres. \nConclusion:  Even though this is a single case, the analysis highlighted the possibility of fNIRS as a promising tool in \nclinical practice for use in pediatric hearing aids and CI users (bimodal listening). However, as it is a single case, the \nfindings of the present study cannot be generalized. Therefore, it becomes necessary to carry out future research, with \na larger sample group, control group (such as normal hearing people) and longitudinal monitoring, these being the \nmain restrictions of this study. Finally, continued research involving the application and analysis of fNIRS data in \nhearing-impaired children using hearing aids (HAs and/or CIs) may contribute to the evaluation, monitoring and \nclinical prognosis of this population. \n \nReferences: \n1.

Methods: A systematic literature review was \ncarried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses \n(PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Nineteen studies were included, 13 of which presented a low risk to \nbias. Conclusion: there were common acquisition parameters for fNIRS in cochlear implant users: \npredominant use of auditory stimuli in the form of words and phrases presented in a free field \nenvironment, bilateral recording of responses in the temporal lobe, incorporation of visual stimuli, \nstudy participants were alert and awake.  \n \nIntroduction:  It is essential to clearly define and share fNIRS acquisition parameters among researchers in order to \nimprove assessment strategies in Cochlear Implant (CI) users. Given this scenario, the present systematic review \nsynthesized studies that investigated the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with speech stimuli \namong CI users. The main objective was to identify the acquisition parameters for the application of fNIRS in this \nspecific population and guide future research in this area. \n \nMethods: The systematic literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses (PRISMA) guidelines 1. PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, \nGoogle Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched using the acronym PECOS (Population; \nExposure; Comparison; Outcome; Study Design). The inclusion criteria were studies involving fNIRS with speech \nstimuli in CI users of any age, with information on acquisition parameters (Prospero, number CRD42022358346). \nThe risk of bias assessment was carried out with the support of the Joanna Briggs Institute tool 2. \n \nResults: Nineteen studies were included, 13 of which presented a low risk of bias. The item that indicated the greatest \nrisk in five studies was the detail of the exposure measurement regarding the fNIRS acquisition parameters. Only three \nstudies did not describe the sample in detail and only one study reported the method protocol and not the outcome, \nmaking it impossible to define its risk of bias in the results category. \n \nConclusion:  Variations in acquisition parameters were attributed to different study objectives. This review identifies \nuniformity in some fNIRS acquisition parameters in cochlear implant users: predominant use of auditory stimuli in \nthe form of words and phrases presented in a free field environment, bilateral recording of responses in the temporal \nlobe, incorporation of visual stimuli as a task form secondary, participants in all studies were uniformly alert and \nawake. Although, I recognize that there are variations that have been attributed to the different objectives between \nstudies. Therefore, multicenter research is needed to further advance the utility of fNIRS in this population. \n \nReferences: \n \n1.

    "Study on improvement of spatial resolution of topography  \n \nKeiko Fukuda, Shuhei Kamogawa  \n \nTokyo Metropo litan Collage of Industrial Technology, Tokyo, Japan  \n fukuda@metro-cit.ac.jp \n \nAbstract:  We propos e to use three kinds of source-detector pairs with different distances to improve \nspatial resoluti on and reduce artifacts. The simulation results using a depth-selective filter algorithm \nshow that surface signal can be reduced with minimum target signal deterioration, and the use of \ntwo different measurement signals allows to detect target signal of different optical transfer path. \n \nIntroduction:  In CW-NIRS , absorption changes are estimated at a point halfway between each source-detector (SD) \npair and the topography displays the changes at the midpoint between the SD pair.  However, a distance of 30 mm or \nmore between optodes is required for obtaining cortical activity, the displayed point position is limited by the optode \narrangement. Therefore, we have proposed an equilateral triangle configuration to improve spatial resolution and to \nreduce artifacts while minimizing the increase in the number of optodes [1]. In this study, we propose improving \nspatial resolution by using three kinds of SD pairs with different distances. \n \nMethods: Figure 1 shows a surface view of the optode arrangement in the equilateral triangle configuration. Three \ntypes of signals are acquired: a source-detector pair between the vertex (SD1), a source-detector pair between the \nvertex and the center of gravity of an adjacent equilateral triangle (SD2), and a short-distance SD pair between the \ncenter of gravity and the vertex (SSD). The measurement signals SD1 and SD2 contain the absorption changes in the \noptical path including the brain activity to be measured, and the measurement signals are projected onto the topography \nat the midpoint between the optodes. SSD signal mainly contains the absorption changes near the surface layer just \nbelow the optodes and is used as a correction signal. Using two types of measurement signals in an equilateral triangle \narrangement leads to a higher \nspatial resolution. We applied the \ndepth selectivity filter [2], one of \nthe inverse problem analysis \nmethods, to the above arrangement \nto verify the improvement of \nspatial resolution. \n \nResults: Simulation analysis was performed for a configuration of eight equilateral triangles arranged laterally shown \nin Fig. 1. According to the distances of SD1 (30mm), SD2 (34.6mm), and SSD (16.7mm), the sensitivity matrix was \nplaced in the surface layer at a depth of 2 mm and in the target layers at depths of 15 mm and 16 mm. The sensitivity \nmatrices are placed only just below the optode in the surface layer and 2 mm apart in the two deep layers. The human \nhead is modeled as a semi-infinite diffusive medium with homogeneous background absorption coefficient μa = 0.02 \nmm−1, reduced scattering coefficient μ′s = 1.00 m m−1. Before applying the depth-selective filter, the signals \nsurrounding t he surface signal indicated by the x-mark were high, and the targeted absorption change could not be \ndetected. After applying the filter, the target signal S1 and S2 could be detected separately. Compared the result to the \nsimple back-projection that contains only the targeted signal, the error is 10% for S1 and 23% for S2, and the \ndegradation due to suppression of the surface signal is small. It was found that the use of two different measurement \nsignals, SD1 and SD2, allows the detection of target signals that could not be detected with one type of signal. Here, \nwe applied this method to equilateral triangle configurations, the method can also be applied to conventional square \nconfigurations. We believe that by using this method, the spatial resolution of NIRS can be easily improved by using \nmeasurement signals in existing source-detector pairs that are not used normal arrangement. \n \nAcknowledgments:  This research is supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant Number JP20K04524. \n \nReferences: \n[1] Fukuda K, Takao A, Adv.

    "Two Types of Cognitive Processes of The C riminals Who \nConceal Involvement of The Case Appears as Bimodal Peaks \nin Their Cerebral Hemodynamic Responses  \n \nKiyomitsu Niiokaa,b, Mayuko Mikamia, Wakana  Kawaia, Simon H. Kuwaharaa,  \nYasushi Kyutokua, and Ippeita Dana* \n \naApplied Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo 855 -1122, Japan  \nbDepartment of Crime and Psychology, The University of Human Env ironments, Matsuyama, Ehime 790 -0825, Japan  \nk.niioka.0913@gmail.com  (Kiyomitsu  Niioka )  \n \nAbstract:  The CIT is a criminal investigation method . We examined the relationship between  \ntemporally synchronized autonomic responses and cortical activation. Thirty  of sixty participants \ncommitted  a mock crime,  and the others did not.  Then, they  performed the CIT task. As a result, in \naddition to the guilty -specific autonomic response s, we observed the distinct cortical activation \npatterns; ( 1) bimodal  peaks  for a crime -relevant question , (2) the greater activation of the right \nS/MTG  and M /IFG . Moreover, the mean Δ[oxyHb]  of 1st peak on the S/MTG and that of 2nd peak \non the M/IFG were positively correlated with sympathetic and parasympathetic indices, respectively.  \n \nIntroduction:  The Concealed Information Test (CIT) in a criminal investigation, often practiced in Japan, determines  \nwhether a suspect is involved in  a case based on multiple autonomic responses against two types of questions: one  \ncrime -relevant question and several crime -irrelevant questions. It is assumed that only the offenders, not the innocents,  \nwill show different responses to the relevant questi ons by their involuntary attention and emotion control.  In recent \nyears, the response fractionation model , which postulates both recognition and concealment  as the cognitive  processes  \nelicit ing responses during the CIT, is prevailing . Accordingly , we measured temporally  synchronized  autonomic and \ncerebral hemodynamic responses to ascertain whether this theoretical hypothesis is valid.  \n \nMethods :  Sixty participants ( 30 males, 3 0 females, mean age 2 1.23 ± 1.41), divided into two groups (guilty/innocent),  \ntook part in the experiment. In the mock  crime session, only the guilty group  were asked to randomly steal one of five \ndifferent items (necklace, ring, brooch, bracelet and  earrings). In the investigation session, all of them  were requir ed \nto perform the CIT task. During the CIT task, autonomic nervous responses including electrodermal activity,  \nrespiration, Electrocardiogram  (ECG ), pulse volume and blood pressure were recorded. Skin conductance response \n(SCR), respiration line  length (RL L), instant heart rate (IHR), nHF, LF/HF, and normalized pulse volume (NPV) were \ncalculated.  Simultaneously, cerebral hemodynamic responses were recorded with the fNIRS device. Individual  \ntimeline data for the oxyHb and deoxyHb  signals were preprocessed with a first -degree polynomial fitting and band -\npass filter of 0.03 -0.1 Hz. Then, we obtained channel -wise and subject -wise ∆[oxyHb] values by calculating the mean  \nof differences between the Hb signals (4 –10 s/10-16 s after trial  onset) and baseline (0 –3 s before trial onset) periods.  \nWe conducted a two -way mixed ANOVA with group ( guilty /innocent ) as the between -subject factor and question \ntype (crime -relevant /irrelevant ) as the within -subject factor to compare each index . \n \nResults:  For the guilty group,  not only the typical autonomic patterns, greater SCR, shorte r RLL, decreed IHR and \nNPV , but also higher LF/HF and lower nHF were observed for a relevant question.  As for hemodynamic response , \nthe guilty group showed bimodal  peaks bounded by 10 s for a crime -relevant question. For the guilty group, the \nactivations on the right S/MTG in 4 -10 s and those on the right M/IFG in 10 -16 s were greater than for the innocent \ngroup. Furthermore, the mean Δ[oxyHb] of 1st peak on the S/M TG and that of 2nd peak on the M/IFG were positively \ncorrelated LF/HF and nHF, respectively. These results suggest that a crime -relevant question would elicit an \nimmediate sympathetic -dominant response  induced by recognition -related process  and a subsequent parasympathetic -\ndominant response  induced  by concealment -related process .  \n \nConclusion:  In conclusion, we demonstrated that  guilty -specific  cortical activation patterns would reflect two \ncognitive processes underlying the CIT. Our new CIT system based on both cortical activation and autonomic \nresponses may not only provide more cues for determining the identification of the criminals, but also help us examine  \nthe validity  of the existing  CIT theories.  374 of 398",

This experimental study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID \nNCT04626453 ) collected  data from sedentary older adults with T2D of 19 participants. Participants underwent \nassessments before and after a 2 -month exercise intervention. Cognitive function and c erebral oxyhemoglobin in the \nprefrontal cortex were measured . Our study r esults indicated reduced overactivation in the left lobe during memory \nencoding and executive function  and increase d activation in bilateral  lobes during memory retrieva l. A two -month \ncombined exercise program enhance d cognition and brain  lateralization may elucidate its effectiveness . \n \nIntroduction:  Research on older adults with diabetes has revealed a significant association between cognitive impairment and diabetes, \nparticularly affecting executive function, processing speed, and memory recall .1,2 However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding \nbrain activation patterns, as measured by functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), during cognitive tasks in older adults with \ncognitive impairment .3Additionally, while exercise training has been linked to improvements in cognitive function, the precise \nparameters by which exercise influences brain activation in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are still not fully under stood .4  \n \nMethods: This experimental study analyzed data from sedentary older adults with T2D, comprising a sample of 19 participants. \nParticipants underwent assessments before and after a 2 -month exercise intervention. The exercise regimen consisted of personalized \nprogressive exercises conducted six days a week. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini -Cog test, which comprises three \nsteps to evaluate memory encoding, executi ve function, and memory retrieval. The Mini -Cog test was administered three times in one \nsession, and the total score from the three attempts was utilized. Cerebral oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2) levels in the prefrontal cortex were \nmeasured using the fNIRS techniqu e during the Mini -Cog test. Changes in HbO 2 (∆HbO 2) and maximum HbO 2, commonly employed \nparameters in previous studies, were used to evaluate brain activation during the Mini -Cog test.  \n \nResults: During memory encoding, ∆HbO 2 significantly decreased by 4.68*10-6 µmm at left medial lobe (p=.046 ) with maximum \nHbO 2 decreasing by 3.11*10-5 µmm in the same region (p=.015). During executive function, peak HbO 2 significantly decreased by \n4.01*10-5 µmm at left lateral lobe  (p=.043).  Conversely, d uring  memory retrieval, ∆HbO 2 significantly enhanced by 4.69*10-7 µmm at \nleft medial lobe (p=.046) and peak HbO 2 significantly increased by 4.94* 10-5 at right lateral lobe (p=.023). Although there was an \nimprovement in the total Mini -Cog score, the result was not  statistically significan t. \n \nConclusion:  Brain activation during the Mini -Cog exhibited left lateralization, with predominant activation observed in the left lobe. \nFollowing the 2 -month exercise intervention, there was a reduction in brain overactivation in the left lobe during memory encoding \nand executive function tasks. Increased activation  in bilateral  lobes was found  during memory retrieval . The reason for this \nphenomenon may lie in the brain's tendency toward bilateral activation during high demand working memory tasks.  The findi ngs \nsuggest that a 2 -month combined exercise program may enhance memory and executive function in older adults with T2D. The \ndirection and strength of lateralization may elucidate the effectiveness of exercise interventions.  \n \nReferences  \n1  Casagrande SS, Lee C, Stoeckel LE, Menke A, Cowie CC.

For data Acquisition, signals of 10 subjects \nwere acquired from motor cortex region of brain using NIRX equipment  for fNIRS  and also sEMG signals were \nextracted from arm surface using Biopac equipment. Then for comparison Classification accuracy was calculated \nusing machine learning algorithms K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  on five feature combinatio n which give accuracy \nof 90.64% on fNIRS and 91.96% on sEMG.  \nIntroduction:  BCI plays an important role in promoting smoother communication and interactions between individuals with motor \nimpairments and others. Moreover, they enable the direct control of assistive devices through brain signals. This paper presents \ncompa rative study  of fNIRS and s EMG  to control the hand gripping (open and close).  Using fNIRS, brain activity is measured by \nusing near -infrared light to estimate cortical hemodynamic activity which occur in response to neural activity while Surface \nElectromyography (EMG) measures muscle response or electrical activity in response to a nerve's stimulation of the muscle. Th is \npaper presents the study in which signals of 10 samples while  opening and closing their hands are measured using both modalities \nthen both are compared using machine learning Algorithm  KNN with five feature combination (Mean Variance Skewness Kurtosis \nSlope) . \nMethods:  For this study,  firstly we acquire signals of 10 subjects using fNIRS and sEMG simultaneously. The Experiment paradigm \nused has 30 sec initial rest, 15 sec activity (hand open close) ,15 sec rest (10 trials) and then 30 sec rest. After Data acq uisition \npreprocessing, feat ure extraction and classification is done in order to calculate accuracy. The optimal feature that we get after \ncalculating accuracies of 54 different combinations was five feature combination ( Mean Variance Skewness Kurtosis Slope) . Then K \nNearest Neighbo rs (KNN) is used to find Classification Accuracy  of both Modalities . Results: The Results are present in Figure 1 \nwhich shows classification accuracy of \nfNIRS and sEMG  subject wise and figure 2 \nshows overall classification accuracy of both \nmodalities  in which KNN gives 90.64% \nclassification accuracy for fNIRS and \n91.96% classification accuracy for sEMG.  \nConclusion:   It is shown in results that \nsEMG give higher accuracy of 91,96% than \nfNIRS which gives 90.64% accuracy in order \nto control hand gripping  because sEMG \nsignals are acquires directly from muscles \nand fNIRS signals are acquired from brain. \nSo the normal insight that sEMG give higher \naccuracy is proved using this study. On the \nother hand fNIRS also give good accuracy \nand also fNIRS has it’s own  benefits. So, \nboth modalities can be used to control hand \ngripping. Future recommendation is that one \ncan use hybrid BCI in which both these \nmodalities fused together can enhance \naccuracy and will work more effectively.

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. \n2 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. \nzeinalou@mgh.harvard.edu \n \nAbstract:  This study investigates Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) photoplethysmography \n(PPG) as a noninvasive method to predict Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) during Carotid \nEndarterectomy (CEA), aiming to overcome the invasiveness of radial artery BP measurement. \nFlexNIRS data collected from nine CEA patients underwent preprocessing and feature extraction \nfor MAP prediction using a Gaussian regression model. The model, incorporating heart rate and \nPPG features, demonstrated accurate MAP prediction (R2 = 0.82, 1.3±11 mmHg accuracy) across \nsubjects. Results suggest NIRS-PPG as a potential noninvasive continuous BP monitoring solution \nduring cardiovascular surgery. \n \nIntroduction:  Radial artery blood pressure (BP) measurement is the established method for monitoring \nhemodynamics in cardiovascular surgery. However, its invasiveness necessitates exploration into noninvasive \ncontinuous BP monitoring. This study investigates Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) photoplethysmography (PPG) \nfor predicting Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) in Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) patients. \nMethods:  Data were collected from nine patients undergoing CEA surgery, with simultaneous recording of blood \npressure using an arterial line (A-line). FlexNIRS data [1], sampled at 266 Hz from the contralateral forehead, were \nacquired during CEA surgery. This data underwent preprocessing to enhance its quality: ambient light subtraction and \nremoval of motion artifact segments via accelerometer analysis. The FlexNIRS signals at 850 nm with a 2.8 cm source-\ndetector separation, were further filtered between 0.5 Hz and 15 Hz using the wavelet transform technique. Prediction \nof MAP utilized a Gaussian regression model augmented with an exponential kernel, as described in the literature [2]. \nThree features were employed in this model: heart rate and two features derived from the first derivative of NIRS-\nPPG (d/dt (NIRS-PPG)) signals. Specifically, as PPG features, the ratio Mp/P1 and the slope containing the points P1 \nand Mp were used. Here, P1 corresponds to the systolic peak, while Mp is defined by the middle between two key \npoints in the cardiac cycle: the midpoint between the dicrotic notch and the systolic peak, and the midpoint between \nthe diastolic peak and the systolic peak. The model was trained over 20 minutes in each subject to learn the feature-\nblood pressure relationship and accurately predict MAP on the remaining data on the same subject. \nResults: The model demonstrated promising performance, as illustrated in Figure 1 for a CEA patient and Figure 2 \nacross all subjects. A significant correlation between predicted and actual MAP readings (R2 = 0.82) was observed, \nwith an accuracy of 1.3±11 mmHg (1.96 SD). \nConclusion:  We showed that the Gaussian regression model utilizing NIRS-PPG data proactive hemodynamic \nmanagement, including post-surgery blood pressure prediction. \nReferences \n1.

Using an Iowa \nPDA Score threshold of 8 points , cerebral NIRS values were significantly lower for infants with \nHSPDA  between the 72nd – 84th HoL, and 120th – 132nd HoL, while marginal significance was found \nbetween the 84th – 96th HoL. \nIntroduction:  Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is common in extremely premature infants, affecting  64-87% of 24 - \n28-week GA infants1. Hemodynamically Significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus (H SPDA) is associated with pulmonary\nhyperperfusion and systemic hypoperfusion to end organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and intestines2. Our aim was to\ntest different Iowa PDA Score thresholds to determine the threshold that provides the greatest physiological distinction\nbetween the continuous cerebral NIRS tracings of extremely premature infants  in the first few days of lif e.\nMethods: This retrospective study was conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, from January \n1st, 2018 – August 2020 , where  an institutional  protocol  recommend ed that all infants born  28 weeks ’ gestation \nundergo monitoring  with a commercially available cerebral NIRS oximeter, INVOS, for at least the first three days \nof life.3 70 infants were included in this analysis. NIRS data were binned into 12 -hour segments with mean NIRS \nvalues calculated every hour  to estimate the standard deviation . Bins that did not include at least 6 hours of data \nwere excluded . NIRS data obtained after 132 HoL were also excluded from the analysis.  Hemodynamic significance \nof the PDA  was defined using the Iowa PDA Score , which assesses the severity of the ductus by combining  points \n(ranging from 0 – 2) assigned to the following Transthoracic Neonatal Echocardiogram ( TnECHO ) parameters ; \nMitral valve E -wave velocity , isovolumetric relaxation time  (IVRT), pulmonary vein  D-wave velocity , left atrium to \naorta ratio  (LA:Ao ratio ), left ventricular output to right ventricular output ratio  (LVO:RVO ratio ), diastolic flow in \ndescending aorta and/or celiac/  middle cerebral artery (MCA ), and PDA size indexed to weight .1 An Iowa PDA \nscore of 6 denotes infants with H SPDA necessitating treatment.1 JMP Pro version 15.2.0 was used for statistical \nanalyses.   \nResults: Using the diagnostic Iowa PDA Score threshold of 6 \npoints, mean cerebral NIRS values  between the two groups \ntrended towards marginal significance between  the 120th – 132nd \nHoL (Figure 1 , left ). When a stricter threshold of 8 points is \nused (indicating more severe PDA) , cerebral NIRS values  were \nsignificantly lower for infants with HSPDA  between the 72nd – \n84th HoL, and 120th – 132nd HoL, while marginal significance \nwas found between the 84th – 96th HoL (Figure 1 , right ). \nConclusion:  This a nalysis illustrates the clinical utility of \ncontinuous cerebral NIRS monitoring  for extremely premature \ninfants  to identify  infants with  severe HSPDA. Future work \nincludes a djusting for potential confounders  (IVH, Hct)  and a prospective multimodal NIRS study examining cerebral \nand renal NIRS values  to detect signs of decreased renal perfusion as an early indication of H SPDA.  \nReferences:  \n1)Moronta, S.C., Bischoff, A.R., Ryckman, K.K.  et al.

    "Continuous blood pressure monitoring  using forehead  \nNIRS-PPG (FlexNIRS) and deep learning  \n \nJohn Sunwoo1, Zahra Einalou1, Mehrdad Dadgostar1, Kuan-Cheng Wu1, Alyssa Martin1, Marco Renna1, \nNikola Otic1, Zachary Starkweather1, Yoonho Oh1, Jason Qu2 and Maria Angela Franceschini1 \n \n1 Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and 2 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.  \njsunwoo@mgh.harvard.edu  \n \nAbstract:  We explored the utility  of forehead near-infrared spectroscopy  photoplethysmography \n(NIRS -PPG) coupled with a deep learning model integrating convolutional and long short -term \nmemory (CNN -LSTM) networks for arterial blood pressure prediction. The model was validated on \ntwo patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, showing strong correlation between predicted and \nactual blood pressure values.  We are validating the model across seven  additional subjects . \nPreliminary results indicate that unsupervised deep learning applied to NIRS -PPG data offers \npromising potential for robust, accurate continuous blood pressure monitoring.  \n \nIntroduction:  Existing light based noninvasive and continuous blood pressure monitoring  devices , such as the ones \nbased  on finger pulse -ox, provide insufficient accuracy.  To address this challenge, we investigated the feasibility of \nforehead NIRS -PPG, allowing for a more robust measurement of pulsatile signal than in a finger, coupled with \nartificial intelligence to predict arterial blood pressure (ABP).  \n \nMethods:  We performed measurements in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) surgery, which entails \nlarge blood pressure changes and requires ABP monitoring with an arterial line. We employed a wearable NIRS device \ncalled FlexNIRS [1], sampled at 266 Hz, p ositioned on the forehead, contralateral to the surgery site. We implemented \na deep learning model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) for morphological feature extraction and \nlong short -term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal feature extrac tion, aiming to accurately predict ABP. This \nmodel was largely adapted and modified from previously published architectures [2 -4]. Specifically, the model \nconsists of one bi -layer LSTM and two LSTMs with 56 hidden units each, followed by two CNNs featuring  100-200 \nkernels ranging in size from 5 to 20 , in combin ation  with rectified linear unit activation layers, pooling layers, and \nfully connected networks for dimension reduction.  The raw NIRS -PPG signal at 850 nm and 2.8 cm source -detector \nseparation was re sampled to 250 Hz and bandpass -filtered at 0.55 – 25 Hz. Four consecutive beats were ensemble \naveraged, and its derivative (d/dt(NIRS -PPG)) was paired, zero -padded, and filled into a bin of 300 samples (2 x 300 \nx #beats) and matched with mean arterial bloo d pressure (MAP) values (1 x #beats) for training the model.  \n \nResults: In four CEA patient s (one female) , with an average of two hours of valid data,  we trained the  CNN -LSTM  \nmodel using a set of periods no more than 1 0-20 minute s among where  the MAP  exhibited large fluctuations , which  \noccurred around clamping and unclamping . MAP was predicted for the remaining untrained data , revealing a strong \ncorrelation between the predicted and actual MAP values  (R=0.96 , 0.87, 0.95, and 0. 80, respectively ; Figure ). \n \nConclusion:  Our findings suggest that deep learning models, utilizing time -series NIRS -PPG data directly without \nprior feature extraction and dimension reduction, hold promising potential for robust, accurate, noninvasive, \ncontinuous ABP monitoring.  In seven  additional \nCEA subjects , we are optimizing our model, \nincluding signal pre-processing  and training data \nselection, to improve prediction accuracy.  \n \nReferences  \n1.

    "Imaging static absorbing properties using w avelength \nmodulated near-infrared spectroscopy  \n \nJeremy C. Hebden, Haoyang Zhang, Danica M. Pacis  \n \nUniversity College London, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, London, WC1E 6BT, UK ,  \nj.hebden@ucl.ac.uk  \n \nAbstract:  A method called  wavelength -modulated near -infrared spectroscopy  is used to estimat e \nthe absolute concentrations of absorbers in highly scattering media using measurements of the rate \nof change of optical attenuation with wavelength. The method is demonstrated using three \nexperimental systems based on a wavelength -modulated source, a spectrometer, and discrete \nsources at adjacent wavelengths. Measurements are independent of absolute intensity and thus less \ninfluenced by changes in coupling  (to which hair is a significant contributor ) which cause artefacts \nin conventional NIRS data . Images of a tissue equivalent phantom clearly reveal internal absorbers \ndespite a random layer of dark hair on the surface.  \n \nIntroduction:  Functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is widely used to determin e localized changes in the \nconcentrations of oxy and deoxy -hemog lobin  from measurement s of changes of the intensity of light diffusely \nreflected from the head and other tissues . Deriving absolute concentrations has been largely inhibited by the unknown \nand variable coupling between the optical probe and the skin . Measurements of spectral derivatives provide a means \nof overcoming this shortcoming.  The rate of change of attenuation A (log intensity) with wavelength  is independent \nof absolute intensity, and Monte Carlo and analytical models [1] suggested the followi ng empirical  relationship:  \n 𝜕𝐴\n𝜕𝜆≈𝑑<𝛽>∑𝑐𝑛𝜕𝜀𝑛\n𝜕𝜆𝑛−𝛼𝜆−𝑝 (1) \nwhere d is the source -detector separation, < > is the average differential pathlength factor  (DPF) , cn and n are the \nconcentrations and molar extinction coefficients of n chromophores, and  and p are unknown coefficients.  So-called \nwavelength -modulated NIRS measure s the spectral gradient A/ directly using a wavelength modulated source , or \nby otherwise measuring a small change in attenuation A in response to a small change in wavelength  [2]. \n \nMethods: Three  experimental systems are being evaluated for measur ing A/ \nbased on: an optical spectrometer  and broadband source ; a supercontinuum laser \nand acousto -optic tunable filter; and pairs of laser diodes emitting at adjacent \nwavelengths. Experiments have been performed on solid phantoms with tissue -\nequivalent optical properties . A source -detector pair was scanned across the \nsurface of a phantom coated with a layer of dark hair. Measurements of A/ at \nmultiple wavelengths are used to deri ve chromophore concentrations by solving \nEq. (1) as a matrix equation  and using an estimate of < >. Images of internal \nabsorbing targets  are generated using the known wavelength -dependence of the \nabsorptions of the target absorber and of melanin (in hair).  \n \nResults: Fig. 1 shows a) the locations and relative absorptions of eight  targets \nembedded in the phantom, and corresponding images showing spatial variation \nin b) optical attenuation  at 760 nm , and c) relative absorption of the phantom \nusing the known (). A non-linear relationship between image contrast and \ntarget absorption was observed , later confirmed using a Monte Carlo model.  \n \nConclusion:  Spectral derivatives are an effective means of imag ing static \nabsorbing properties, uninfluenced by variable coupling due to hair.  \n \nReferences  \n[1] Hebden, J.C.  et al.

    "Changes in Cerebral Haemodynamic Responses During a \nSustained Attention Task Following Exertional \nHyperthermia \n \nNaomi Michiko1,3*, Sharifah Badriyah Alhadad1,3,4, Louisa Si Xian Lim3, Raagavi Mani1, \nXiang Ren Tan2,3, Jason Kai Wei Lee1,3,4, Ivan Cherh Chiet Low1,3 \n \n1Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore  \n2Health and Social Sciences, Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore  \n3Human Potential Translational Research Programme, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore  \n4Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore  \n*Correspondence: naomimichiko@u.nus.edu  \n \nAbstract:  The effects of exertional hyperthermia on neural responses  and sustained attention \nremains equivocal. We evaluated the continuous changes in cerebral haemodynamic responses in \nbilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices during a sustained attention task  at the start and end of \nexercise  under heat stress . Exertional hyperthermia under warm environmental conditions resulted \nin decreased cerebral blood volume and higher error rate compared with cool environmental \nconditions.  Findings suggest potential  associations between  alterations in cerebral haemodynamic \nresponses and impairments in sustained attention during exercise in the heat . \n \nIntroduction:  Exertional h yperthermia  impairs cognitive performance [1] , with prior research suggesting  alterations \nwithin the central nervous system . Specifically, i n occupational or sporting settings , sustained attention is crucial to \nensure safety, make informed decisions an d to maintain focus on tasks.  Nevertheless, how exercise and heat stress  \ncould impact  neural responses  and sustained attention remains uncertain. Hence, we evaluated the continuous changes \nin cerebral haemodynamic responses and its impact on sustained attention during  exertional hyperthermia.  \nMethods: Ten physically active males (55 ± 3% maximal oxygen consumption  (VO 2max) ) completed three \nrandomised experimental trials in 32. 0 ± 0.2°C dry bulb temperature (T db) and 70 ± 2% relative humidity (RH) \n(WARM), 32.0 ± 0. 2°C T db and 71 ± 2% RH with facial cooling using a fan (WARM+FC), and 22. 2 ± 0.4°C T db and \n68 ± 9% RH (COOL).  In each trial, participants walked on a treadmill at 5 4 ± 4% VO 2max until volitional exhaustion \nor till a body core temperature of 39.5°C. Sustained attention was assessed using a  gradual -onset continuous \nperformance task (gradCPT)  at the start and end of exercise.  Changes in oxyhaemoglobin (Δ[HbO]) and \ndeoxyhaemoglobin (Δ[HbR]) concentrations in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) were continuously \nmonitored using fNIRS . The sum of Δ[HbO] and Δ[HbR]  (Δ[HbT]) , a measure of cerebral blood volume changes , \nand the difference between Δ[HbO] and Δ[HbR] (Δ[Hbdiff]) , an index of cortical activation , were calculated . One-\nway repeated measures ANOVA  was performed to test for statistical differences between trial conditions . \nResults: Higher fold change in error rate was observed in WARM relative to COOL ( p < 0.05 ), accompanied by \ndecreased  Δ[Hb T] in WARM relative to COOL in the left DLPFC  (p < 0.05 , Figure 1 ). Bilateral DLPFC displayed \nno difference in Δ[Hbdiff] between WARM and COOL ( p > 0.05).  \n \nConclusion:  Exertional hyperthermia under warm environmental conditions resulted in decreased cerebral blood \nvolume  and more errors made . Such findings could indicate associations between alterations in cerebral \nhaemodynamic responses  and impairments in sustained attention  during exercise in the heat.  \nReferences  \n1.

    "Using fNIRS to explore neural correlates of the clinical \nprogression of Parkinson Disease during the miniBESTest: \nA protocol for a pilot feasibility study. \nMeghan Bjalme -Evans BSc.,  Dipti Wani PhD, Kevin Heffernan PhD FACSM, Lori Quinn  PT EdD FAPTA  \nTeachers College, Columbia University, 525 W 120th St., New York, NY 10027  \nmb5138@tc.columbia.edu   \nParkinson Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in impaired motor function due to loss of dopamine in the  basal \nganglia . Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a unique technology in PD research because we can observe the brain \nhemodynamic response during naturalistic movements. The current study aims to determine the feasibility of using fNIRS during  \ncommon clinical test batteries among people with PD (PwP), specifically in the feasibility of testing protocol, the utility of a  range of \nfNIRS related outcome measures, and collect outcome data to determine the sample size required for future large -scale trials with \nfNIRS in PwP.  \nIntroduction: PD rehabilitation research relies predominantly on therapist administered motor test battery measures \nto evaluate the status of the disease and risks for falls. Most neuroimaging techniques, like EEG and fMRI, have \nlimitations in capturing neural activity during dynamic motor tasks. fNIRS has been successfully used to investigate \nneural correlates during dynamic motor tasks like dual -tasking and walking in PwP, however, fNIRS has not been \nused during the execution of a whole battery, to the au thors’ knowledge. Hence, the aim of this study is to examine \nthe feasibility of fNIRS in capturing hemodynamic response during the execution of a clinical test battery for PD. \nMethods: We will examine 30 PwP, 10 with Hoehn Yahr (HY) scores of I, 10 with HY scores of II, and 10 with \nHY scores of III, and 30 healthy older adults using a Sport2 NIRSx device (16x16 montage). Participants will \nperform14 subtests  included in the miniBESTest  clinical battery while donning the NIRS device. The NIRS device \nwill be activated prior to each subtest. Subtests of each battery will be repeated three times to strengthen response \nactivity. The NIRS device will then be deactivated, and data consolidated prior to the next run.  Testing will coincide \nwith the ‘On’ phase of medication for those participants on antiparkinsonian medications. Given the facets of \nstanding and walking balance and dual tasking in the miniBESTest, and previous research with fNIRS o n PwP, we \nwill explore the frontal lobe. Results: We will use data -driven analysis of mean increased signal amplitude channel -\nwise across the frontal lobe during each subtest using group -level activation mapping. We will calculate recruitment, \nretention, and outcome measure variation. We will calculate effect sizes for continuous outcome measures for \ncomparison between control and PwP group differences as well as between PwP group differences across stages to \ninform future power analysis on HY scores (I v. II v. III). Analysis will be supplemented with Turbo -Satori \nsoftware, with focus on the frontal lobe. Concluding Thoughts: The advent of fNIRS in neurorehabilitative \nresearch is still a new, largely unexplored area. With this study, we hope to evaluate the ease of use of fNIRS in \nevaluating clinical test batteries. The study may open up new opportunities for a larger, more com prehensive \nresearch methodology in PwP.  If found feasible with reliable outcome measures, fNIRS could be used as a validated \noutcome measure, opening many new opportunities in PD rehabilitation research.  \nReferences:  \nBonilauri, A., Intra, F.

    "Adjusted effective multiplicity  (Meff) for family -wise error \nrate in fNIRS data with a small sample size  \nY. Yamamotoa, W. Kawaia, T. Hayashib, M. Ugac, Y. Kyutokua and I. Dana\naApplied  Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan , \n bFaculty of Science and Engineering, Yamato University, Osaka, Japan,  \ncFaculty  of Health Science, Health Science University, Yamanashi, Japan,  \nPresenting Author email address: a20.4x83@g.chuo -u.ac.jp  \nAbstract:  Multi -channel fNIRS analysis often requires  correction for  family -wise error rate  in null-\nhypothesis -significance  testing. One of the plausible approach es is the Meff method , which balances  \nType Ⅰ and Type Ⅱ errors by considering  inter-channel correlation . However,  there is a concern \nabout too liberal correction in the case of small sample size. In this study, w e aimed to reevaluate \nthe applicability of Meff method to fNIRS data with a small sample size , utilizing simulations. \nConsequently, a valid Meff can be derived by employing  a typical exponential model. We \ndemonstrated that the Meff approach remains effective . \nIntroduction:  Recent  advancement s in multi -channel functional  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) ha ve led to a \nsignificant expansion in the number of channels  (M). This increase in multiplicity necessitates the control of family -\nwise error  rate (FWE R) in null-hypothesis -significance testing . The typical methods, Bonferroni correction and its \nderivatives, are too conservative. Uga et al. (2015) introduc ed the effective multiplicity ( Meff) method, which considers \nthe correlation between channels.  However, this method has concern to lose its validity when the sample size  (N) is \nsmaller than M, leading to a rank deficiency in the eigenvalue  of the correlation matrix and hindering the accuracy of \nMeff calculations. Hence, w e aimed to reevaluate the validity  of Meff methods for fNIRS data with a small N. \nMethods: We prepared four different sets of experimental data and  conducted a two -step verification process. In \nExperiment 1, random r esampling simulations were performed to  explore the relationship between N and Meff. Based \non th ese result s, Experiment  2 applied  a typical exponential model ,  𝑦= −𝑎𝑒𝑏𝑥+𝑐, to the relationship and\ninvestigated whether the valid Meff can be predicted from a small N. We set the  target value of the prediction as the  \nMeff value at N = M + 1, where all eigenvalues were obtaine d. The model was fitted  in accordance with  the result of \nExperiment 1 . Subsequently, predicted value s were obtained by the model 1000 times for each N. \nResults:  Experiment 1 revealed the Meff values were underestimated \nwhen the N was smaller than the M. However, an exponential pattern \nwas observed  (Figure 1). In Experiment  2, as N increased, the average \nprediction converged towards the target value, and the SD decreased \n(Figure 2). The percentage of prediction error against the target values \ndecreased to less than 5% for N = 25 to 36 in datasets with 44 and 52 \nchannels.  \nConclusion:  The relationship between N and Meff was approximated \nwith a typical exponential model.  Predictive results show  that an N of \n60 to 70 percent  relative  to M is sufficient to predict valid  Meff values. \nThese finding s indicate  the Meff correction is applicable  in fNIRS \nstudies with an N smaller than M. Thus, the Meff correction,  which \nconsiders inter -channel correlation , could serve as a promising \nalternative to Bonferroni correction and its derivatives.  \nReference:  \n1.Uga, M.  et al.

    "Shedding light on Fibromyalgia: Developing a Machine -\nLearning -Based Diagnostic Tool Using fNIRS  \nMichal Weiss1, Alexandra Zhuravlyova1, Hadeel Sal meh1, Pavel Goldstein1 \n1.The School of Public H ealth , University of Hai fa, Israel  \nmichalweiss87@gmail.com  \nAbstract:  This study develops a machine learning -based tool for diagnosing fibromyalgia (FM) \nusing functional near -infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We recorded cortical activity from 36 FM \npatients and 33 age -matched controls, focusing on frontal and sensory -motor are as. Data was \nprocessed to remove  artifacts and analyzed for connectivity and task -based features  during rest and \nduring str ess. A convolutional neural network, trained on 85% of our dataset, achieved an 89% \naccuracy rate in diagnosing FM, identifying all FM patients accurately while misdiagnosing one \ncontrol. This biomarker predominantly reflects frontal cortex activity, offering  clinical utility and \ninsights into the role of stress mechanisms in FM.  \nIntroduction:  FM is a chronic pain syndrome that affects 5% of the population , mostly women . It is often \naccompanied  by other symptoms  such as depression,  fatigue  and m ore. It ta kes years to diagnose Fibromyalgia, and \nthere is no single test for it. The current diagnosis pr ocess is based on e xclusion  of other clinical  conditions , and \nself-report  of sympto ms. The unde rlying mech anism in FM is not clear yet . There fore, there is an acute ne ed for \nobjective tools for FM diagnosis . Previous fNIRS  studies suggested that  there are  differences in cortical activity \nbetween  FM patients and controls1. In the current  study, we a im to develop a machine learning based tool for FM \ndiagnosis.  \nMethods:  We recorded cortical activity  of 36 FM female s and 33 age-matched healthy females  with NIRSport2 NIRx \nfNIRS device. The montage covered  frontal and sensory -motor cor tex areas and  included 46 channels along with 8 \nshort channels . The cortical activity was measure d during rest, during a n ecological  stressful task2, and rest after stress. \nData was  preprocessed for  the removal of motion artefacts and global physiological  activit y. Feature engineering  \nincluded the calculation of resting state connectivity  and as well as single channels feature extraction from the average  \nsignal in the task data (such as minimum , maximum , kurtosis  etc.,). Datasets were divided  into training  (85%) and t est \n(15%). Feature m atrices per subject  from the training group  were fed into a convolutional neural network  that was \ntrained to detect FM patients.  \nResults: The diagnostic accuracy was 89% in the test group, which did not participate in training . All FM patients  in \nthe test group  were correctly diagnosed, and 1 healthy participant was wrongl y diagnosed as an FM patient. This result \nwas also evident when  choosing just the 20 best features. The best features  included both  features from resting state \nand the stressful  task. Most of the 20 best features were localized to fronta l cortical areas.  \nConclusion:  The current study present s a biomarker  for FM based on fNIRS  activity duri ng resting and during a \nstressful task . We plan to test  additional  datasets in order to fu rther validate ou r biomarker. In addition to its clinical  \nutility, the current study shed more light on the involvement  of stress mechanism  in FM . \nReferences \n1.Donadel, D.G., Zortea, M., Torres, I.L.S. et al.

Bowden1,2,3 \n1Vanderbilt Biophotonics Center , Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA  \n2Department of Biomedical Engineering , Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA  \n3Department of Electrical Engineering , Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA  \n*seth.b.crawford@vanderbilt.edu\nAbstract:  Standardization of c ontact pressure is important to ensure accurate data collection during \nCW-fNIRS device evaluation procedures. We developed an apparatus that utilizes spring loading \nand a pressure readout module to allow researchers to control and standardize contact pressure \nbetween a phantom and device. We tested the apparatus design by collecting successive blocks of \nraw intensity  data and comparing the signal average ( xࡃ ,) standard deviation ( ı), coefficient of \nvariation (CV) and signal -to-noise ratio (SNR). The apparatus averages a 3.9% signal int ensity \ndifference between successive periods for a custom -built fNIRS device.  \nIntroduction:  For researchers  developing CW -fNIRS systems , validation procedures are critical to ensure signal \naccuracy and system reliability. A common approach is to co nduct signal stability tests and collect  data with tissue -\nmimicking phantoms.  Because signal strength can change with contact pressure, c ontrolling for contact pressure \nduring phantom procedures is important  for isolating the causes of noise and poses an obstacle for accurate data \ncollection and system evaluation when unaddressed.\nMethods: We fabricated a n apparatus to control contact pressure to enable repeatable, standardized measurements \nfrom a tissue -mimicking phantom during fNIRS system validation procedures. An overview of the apparatus is \nprovided in Figure 1 a: the fNIRS device under test is loaded on the bottom and a phantom is sandwiched between the \ncompressor and the device. The compressor  comprised 3D-printed top and bottom pieces made of PLA filament , and \nthe design utilized a spring -loading approach  to apply pressure . To measure the amount of force being generated, we \nplaced a pressure pad attached to a readout module within the system. We finally tested the apparatus by collecting \nrepeated blocks of intensity data from a custom -built 33 -channel headband device  and an  epoxy -based optical phantom \n(s’ = 0.11 mm-1, a = 0.1 mm-1). We collected three 40-second blocks of raw voltage data at both 740 and 850nm. \nFor each measurement, we adjusted the apparatus to a pressure readout of 19g . \nResults: Figure 1b shows the signal average ( xࡃ ,)standard deviation ( ı), coefficient of variation (CV) and signal -to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) across both wavelengths. The device had strong repeatability, with an average percent change in \nsignal intensity of only 3.9% between successive blocks of data collection.  \nConclusion:  The phantom apparatus provides controlled, repeatable contact pressure between an fNIRS device and \nphantom , which is useful  for system evaluation and stability testing. Future efforts will aim to  improve standardization \nof contact pressure.  \nFigure 1: (a) Overview of the contact pressure -standardized phantom apparatus.

    "MotionArtifactCorrectionin preschoolers’data:\nComparison of fivepipelines\nElizavetaIvanova1,MojtabaSoltanlou1,2\n1School of Psychology, University of Surrey, UK\n2Department of Childhood Education, University of Johannesburg, South Africa\ne.ivanova@surrey.ac.uk\nAbstract: This study investigates motion artifact correction methods in preschoolers’ fNIRS data.\nUsing QT-NIRS in the pre- and post-correction, we compared five different motion artifact\ncorrection methods using real data in preschoolers at the age of 2.5-4.5 years. We found significant\nimprovements using Wavelet and Wavelet+TDDR corrections over the other methods. This study\nis the first to compare various pipelines for preschoolers’ data and to use QT-NIRS as an objective\ncomparison of motion artifact correction methods.\nIntroduction: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is one of the most convenient methods to measure\nbrain responses in children. However, the most challenging part of fNIRS data analysis is finding the most suitable\nmotion artifact (MA) corrections. While such discussions are raised for fNIRS studies involving infants and school\nchildren (see Gemignani & Gervain, 2021 and Fishburn et al., 2021), the most appropriate choice for MA correction\nfor preschoolers’ datasets has not been investigated. Meanwhile, the insights from infant or school children studies\ncannot be extended to studies in preschoolers due to changing variability of the hemodynamic response during the\nchildhood stage (Gemignani & Gervain, 2021). Moreover, preschoolers are much more mobile than other groups\nand have low tolerance (those who worked with preschoolers know what we mean). The purpose of this study is to\nmake the first attempt at finding the most suitable MA correction for preschoolers' data.\nMethods: We applied well-known MA corrections (Wavelet, TDDR, Wavelet+TDDR, PCA, Baseline PCA) on a\ndataset of 20 preschoolers, aged 2.5 to 4.5 years old measured with an audio-visual numerical matching task. To\ncompare the quality of datasets pre- and post-correction, we used QT-NIRS (Hernandez & Pollonini et al., 2020),\nwith the set parameters of scalp coupling index (SCI) = 0.6 and peak spectral power (PSP) = 0.1. This is the most\nestablished and reproducible method of fNIRS data quality check. In QT-NIRS, the data series is split into 5-sec\nwindows with no overlap. A window is considered of a good quality, when both SCI and PSP values are reached.\nWe compared the number of bad windows pre- and post-correction between those five methods, using\nnon-parametric tests.\nResults: The analysis revealed significant improvement of data with Wavelet correction (M=154.4, SD=81.07)\ncompared to no correction (M=160.95, SD=85.77), z=2.64, p=0.009, as well as with Wavelet+TDDR correction\n(M=157.1, SD=84.91) compared to no correction, z=2.17, p=0.031. PCA correction significantly worsened the data\n(M=206.15; SD=73.13), as compared to no correction, t(19)=-3.14, p=0.005. We further explored the correction\nmethods by splitting it into high-noisy (n=8) and low-noisy (n=12) datasets, based on the number of bad windows\n(>170 windows were considered high-noisy). Interestingly, we observed significant improvement of high-noisy data\nwith Wavelet correction (M=229.5, SD=71.75) compared to no correction (M=244.38, SD=69.72), t(7)=2.784,\np=0.027; but for low-noisy data, we observed significant improvement of data with Wavelet+TDDR correction\n(M=102.25,SD=36.07) compared to no correction (M=105.3, SD=34.34), t(11)=2.487, p=0.03.\nConclusion: This is the first study that compares different MA corrections in preschoolers’ data and uses QT-NIRS\nto compare the effects of MA corrections on the data. Based on our early findings, it is suggested that while Wavelet\nand Wavelet+TDDR corrections significantly improve the preschoolers data, the high-noisy data benefits more from\nWavelet correction, whereas the low-noisy data benefits more from Wavelet+TDDR. We will further discuss the\nreplication of the findings in a new dataset and provide user friendly suggestions for selection of MA corrections.\nReferences\n1. Fishburn, F. A., Ludlum, R.

    "Validity of visual processing assessed by fNIRS as a potential \nbiomarker in Neuroscience: systematic evaluation of measure \nreliability \nScaffei E1, Mazziotti R2,3, Bosetti C 1,4,  Paese S1,4, Bianucci C1,4, Battini R 1,4 Baroncelli L1,3 \n1 Department of Neu roscience, IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation, Pisa, Italy  \n2 Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Pharmacology and Child Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy  \n3 Institute of Neuroscience, CNR, Pisa, Italy  \n4 Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy  \nAbstract : The t emporal reproducibility  of fNIRS signal s is a crucial issue for establishing  its validity as a \npotential  biomarker of brain function. Here , our objective is  to systematically evaluate  the reliability of a \nnewly standardized fNIRS procedure for measuring visual -evoked hemodynamic responses (vHDR) in the \noccipital cortex. To validate the consistency of the vHDR metric, we conducted a test -retest study involving \na cohort of 50 healthy adults at three diffe rent time points. Additionally, we explored the circadian \nvariability of the vHDR metric. Our findings reinforce  previous literature highlighting the potential utility \nof fNIRS in the biomarker  domain.  \nIntroduction : Previous studies have indicated that fNIRS may offer a feasible and valuable  measure of  brain  function \nthrough event -related sensor y processing  analysis ( 1). Investigations in developmental age are currently growing  (2), \ninvolving both typical and atypical cohorts (3). Nonetheless, the reliability of a specific experimental paradigm is crucial \nfor establishing the validity of a biomarker and its potential clinical application in neuroscience.  Here , we systematically \nevaluated the test -retest reliability of the fNIRS visual -evoked hemodynamic responses (vHDR)  in a cohort of adults to \nsubstantiate its potential validity as a biomarker in Neurodevelopmental Disorders cohorts.  \nMethods: The experimenta l protocol was designed to enhance its entertaining value  and optimize its suitability for use \nwithin children cohorts. Specifically, visual stimulation was achieved using an event -related paradigm that involved \npresenting a simple checkerboard overlaid with an isoluminant commercial cartoon at a 20% contrast level. The number \nof trials was set to n = 20.  Detailed descriptions of the experimental procedure and data analysis pipeline can be found in \nprevious literature ( 4). For the current study, fifty healthy volunteers (25 women and 25 men) participated in two recording \nsessions. Test -retest reliability of our measurements was assessed across three intervals: a short -term repetition of fNIRS \nrecording (intrasession: timepoints 0 -1), and two longer retest intervals (intersession: timepoint 0 -2 at 2 months and \ntimepoint 0 -3 at approximately 2 years). Consequ ently, all participants (50 subjects) underwent two recording sessions \nwithin a single session to evaluate the short -term test -retest reliability of the fNIRS vHDR metric.  Furthermore , 23 adult \nsubjects (12 women; mean age at enrollment: 31.6 ± 4.1 (SD) years) were recruited to assess long -term test -retest \nreliability, and an additional 27 healthy adult volunteers were enlisted to evaluate mid -term test -retest reliability (13 \nwomen; mean age: 30.4 ± 4.3 (SD) years). Additionally, circadian variability of the fNIRS  response was examined in a \nsubgroup of 15 participants by comparing vHDR across three different daily recordings.  \nResults: The vHDR responses elicited by our event -related paradigm w ere captured by measuring the grand averages of \nTotal -Hb (THb), Oxy -Hb (OHb), and Deoxy -Hb (DHb) concentration changes in the occipital cortex of the experimental \ncohort  (4). The groupwise intrasession reliability of the fNIRS measurements yielded highly significant results for both \naverage values and best channel values across all metrics. Additionally, we analyzed the data by calculating the mean \ndifference for each pair o f recordings, both for average values and best channel values of vHDR metrics (THb, OHb, \nDHb), revealing consistency between intrasession recordings.  Furthermore, we observed the same level of consistency in \nthe intersession reliability of the vHDR signal.  Indeed, the correlation of signal amplitudes across the timepoints 0 -3 was \nsignificant for the metrics tested. Moreover, the longitudinal analysis of paired differences did not reveal any significant \ndiscrepancies in signal distribution, either for the 0 -2 timepoint or the 0 -3 interval, across all metrics . \nConclusion : Collectively, t hese results demonstrate a high level of intra -subject agreement between two distinct vHDR \nmeasurements, affirming the robust reliability of this innovative approach and its potential utility as a valuable biomarker \nof brain function in clin ical cohorts.  \nReferences :  1. van de Rijt  L et al. “Measu ring Cortical Activity During Auditory Processing with Functional Near - \nInfrared Spectroscopy.” Journal of hearing science  vol. 8,4 (2018)  \n2.Su, W et al . “The use of functional near -infrared spectroscopy in tracking neurodevelopmental\ntrajectories in infants and children with or without developmental disorders: a systematic review.” Frontiers\nin psychiatry  vol. 14 1210000. 14 Sep.

    "fNIRS brain imaging at 1 month of age in the UK and The \nGambia – a multi-paradigm approach \nA Blasia, J Benerradib, B Blancob, C Bulgarellia,c, I Greenhalghb, E Mbyed, S McCanne, M \nRozhkob, E Tourayd, S Mooree, C Elwella, S Lloyd-Foxb and The BRIGHT Team \na!\"#$%&'\"(& )* Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, London, UK ; bDepartment  of Psychology, \nUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK ; cCentre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, UK ; dMRC Unit The \nGambia  at the  London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, The Gambia ; eWomen & Children's Health, King’s College London , UK\nAbstract:  At the first fNIRS session of the  Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) \n(www.globalfnirs.org ) at 1 months of age, we use a multi -paradigm approach while infants sleep, \nto investigate  brain responses  during presentation of a range of auditory stimuli . Our preliminary \nresults show that infant s developing in the UK and The Gambia (GM)  present different response \npatterns to the same stimuli. We will investigate  further these differences by studying the brain \nnetworks underpinning these responses from  the functional connectivity (FC) data collected in  the \nsame sessions, and by incorporating contextual factors into the analysis.   \nIntroduction:  Conception to the first 1000 days of life is a crucial period of brain development, where vulnerability \nto adversity is the highest. However, only a fraction of developmental research is conducted in the communities that \nface the highest levels of adversity factors1. The longitudinal Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) project was \nestablished to  study cognitive development in rural Gambia  (GM , N=204 enrolled ), in a reg ion where adversity factors \ncommonly lead to under -nutrition during infancy . A smaller cohort (N=62) of UK infants w as also enrolled  in the \nproject . Infants participated in repeated sessions  from 1 to 24 months of age2. Here we describe the brain responses of \neach cohort  to the fNIRS tasks implemented at the  1-month visit in both sites .  \nMethods:  fNIRS data were collected with the NTS system (Gowerlabs Ltd. London, UK)  using an 18 -channel \nheadgear fitted over the inferior frontal and temporal regions bilaterally . The infants slept on their parents’ lap while \nlistening to (1) (the Social task) human vocal  (V) or toy  (N) sounds3; (2) (the Habituation and Novelty Detection \nHaND task)  repeating  sentence s spoken by a female voice ( Fam1 , 2 and 3 ; 15 trials ) that switched to a male voice \n(Novelty ; 5 trials) and back to female ( Pot-test; 5 trials)4 and (3) (the Functional connectivity task) silence/ambient \nnoise . Here we present preliminary results with data pre -processed and analysed following pipelines used  in previous \npublications3,4. This analysis included N=150 participants for the Social  and N=136 for the HaND  tasks from the GM \ncohort ; and N=46 for the Social  and N=39 for the HaND  tasks , from the  UK cohort . Analysis of FC are ongoing .  \nResults: A region -of-interest -based3 preliminary  analysis  of the HaND data showed a significant linear (p<0.001) \ntrend indicating continuous habituation in the GM but not the UK cohort over temporal regions  (Fig.1) . Analysis of \nthe Social task4 show ed stronger responses to non -vocal sounds  in the UK but not the GM  over bilateral posterior \ntemporal regions  (Fig. 2).           \nConclusion:  The lack of differentiation between conditions observed in the GM cohort may be due to contextual \nfactors or to different developmental trajectories in the two populations . We will  investigate the neural underpinnings \nof these differences by  estimating task -free FC from data collected in the same session . To investigate the potential \nmodulatory effects of context, we will study correlations with  behavioural measures such as parent -child interaction,  \nthe Neonatal Assessment Behavioural Scale , as well as  information about family context  and infant sleep  patterns . \nReferences:  (1) Basnight -Brown et al.
