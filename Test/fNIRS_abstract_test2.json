Our results show that both  autistic and non -autistic school-age children tolerate \nHD-DOT, and HD-DOT is sensitive to autism -associated differences in brain function . \nIntroduction:  Recent advances in functional brain imaging show promise to provide valuable biomarkers of autism \nspectrum disorder (ASD)  diagnostic likelihood  and behavioral trait severity. However, traditional neuroimaging \nmodalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) require participants to remain still in a loud, \nconfined environment, posing difficulties for children, particularly those with ASD. Herein, we aimed to establish the \nfeasibility of high-density diffuse optical tomography (H D-DOT) [1], a minimally constraining optical neuroimaging \nmodality that can map brain function in an open and naturalistic environment,  to assess brain function in ASD and \nnon-autistic control (NAC) children using a biological motion perception paradigm  [2]. \nMethods: We imaged 46 ASD children age 7 -18 years, 49 NAC, and 17 pro band siblings as they viewed coherent \nand scrambled movie clips  of point-light biological motion . The HD-DOT instrument contain ed a dense array of 96 \nsources and 92 detectors that support  >1,200 overlapping measurements  within 4cm  per wavelength and provide a \nsmooth sensitivity profile on the cortical surface. Data processing and image reconstruction were performed  using the \nNeuroDOT pipeline in MATLAB  [1]. We assessed data quality using the  pulse signal -to-noise ratio  (SNR), good \nmeasurements (GM) percentage, and motion levels with the global variance in the temporal derivative  (GVTD) [3]. \nWe assessed group -level cortical brain function with statistical \nparametric mapping. Additionally, we tested for brain -behavior \nassociations with dimensional metrics of autistic traits, as measured \nwith the Social Responsiveness Scale -2 (SRS), with hierarchical \nregression models.  \nResults: Data quality assessment s revealed no significant \ndifferences in data quality and motion between ASD and NAC . \nAdditionally, confirming results in fMRI studies, we found that \nNAC participants presented stronger brain activity contrast \n(coherent > scrambled) than ASD children in six cortical regions \nrelated to visual, motor, and social processing. Moreover , \nregression models revealed multiple cortical regions in ASD \nparticipants where brain function is significantly associated with \ndimensional measures of autistic traits.  \nConclusion:  This study demonstrates that HD -DOT is sensitive to \nbrain function  that differentiates between NAC and ASD groups \nand correlates with dimensional measures of ASD traits. Overall, \nthis study highlights the effectiveness of HD -DOT as a comparable \ntool to fMRI for studying brain function in autistic children \nthroughout childhood development in a naturalistic setting . \nReferences:  \n[1] Eggebrecht A.

    "Functional speciali sation in the first years of life : \nlongitudinal characterisation of  social perception  with fNIRS\nJ Benerradi  a, C Bulgarelli  b, A Blasi c, B Blanco  a, S McCann  d, B Milosavljevic e, E Mbye f, E Touray f,\nS Moore d, f, C Elwell c, S Lloyd -Fox a, The BRIGHT  Team\na Psychology, University of Cambridge , UK; b Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London, UK ; \ncMedical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London , UK; d Women & Children's Health, King’s College London , UK; \ne Biological and Behavioural Science s, Queen Mary  University of London, UK ; f The Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia  at the London \nSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, The Gambia  \nPresenting Author email address:  jb2615@cam.ac.uk  \nAbstract:   By studying brain  responses to social perception longitudinally in infants and children \nin The Gambia , we found that social vocal stimuli elicit ed a significantly slower and stronger \nresponse than auditory non -vocal stimuli across all 6 age points collected in the  Brain Imaging for \nGlobal Health (BRIGHT)  project from 5 months to 5 years old . We show the advantage of studying \nbrain activation informed by the  speed and magnitude of the response  with functional near -infrared \nspectroscopy (fNIRS)  to characterise the brain response  more comprehensively . \nIntroduction : Infants and children in low- and middle -income countries have historically been under -represented in \nneurodevelopmental research , despite being often exposed to early adversity  which can impact cognitive development.  \nThe Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) project enabled the collection of a large dataset for studying cognitive \ndevelopment  longitudinally  from birth to 5 years old  in The Gambia and UK1. While social processing has been\nstudied often in infants younger than 1 year  of age in high-income countries , we here present findings with functional \nnear-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS) on a social task in the Gambian cohort  from 5 to 60 months. \nMethods: Participants  were presented with social videos  \naccompanied by vocal and non -vocal sounds  following a block \ndesign; a study paradigm common in previous literature and adapted \nto the local context2. Participants were tested  at 5 months ( N=127), 8\nmonths ( N=110), 12 months ( N=116), 18 months ( N=111), 24\nmonths ( N=112) and 60 months ( N=124) with fNIRS  from the\ntemporal and inferior frontal brain regions . Channels with low scalp \ncoupling were pruned and  motion artefacts corrected using spline \ninterpolation  and wavelet  filtering3. The data was converted into oxy -\n(HbO) and deoxy -haemoglobin  (HbR), and blocks were averaged for \neach condition ( vocal or non-vocal). We studied longitudinally  the \naverage time -to-peak (speed) and peak amplitude  (magnitude)  of the \nhaemodynamic response function (HRF) , for each condition , which \ninformed the appropriate time  window to selected for  statistical \nanalysis on  HbO and HbR  to investigate brain activation . \nResults: We found a significantly greater activation  in response to \nvocal compared to non-vocal stimuli across all ages, located  \nbilaterally  in temporal regions but also in  the inferior frontal gyr i. \nThis becomes more widespread with ag e, with activation on 8 out of \n34 channels at 5 months compared to  21 out of 34 at 60 months  on \nthis vocal minus non -vocal contrast . Furthermore, HbO and HbR \nreached their peak amplitude significantly slower in response to \nsocial vocal compared to non -vocal stimuli (Fig. 1) consistently\nfrom 5 to 60 months (all p-values < 0.05  except HbR at 60 months  where \np-value < 0.1 ), with the absolute amplitude of the peak  also appearing to decrease with age up to 24 months .\nConclusion:  Studying the speed and magnitude of the response with fNIRS  enabled to have more details about the \nbrain response s to social perception  in infants and children  longitudinally , but also to inform the time  window on \nwhich to focus statistical analysis . Ongoing work is now investigating whether amplitude and time -to-peak change as \na function of the cortical location to gain further insight into  the dynamics of the response across ages . \n1.

To address this, we examined longitudinal \nchanges in visual neurocognition  from infancy to toddlerhood in 6- and 9-month-old children from \nlow and middle/high socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds in a large LMIC  cohort. We found \nthat there were developmental changes in both behavioural performance and associated left -\nlateralized parietal activation from infancy to toddlerhood, with mor e robust changes in children \nfrom the high SES 9 -month-old cohort. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on \nneurocognition in children from LMIC countries.  \nIntroduction : Each year, 250  million children in  LMIC fail to reach their developmental potential . Despite this, \nthe nature of developmental changes in neurocognitive function in the first 1000 days of life remains under -\nexplored, especially using longitudinal methods. In the current study,  we first examined developmental changes \nin visual neurocognition from infancy to toddlerhood in children in rural India. Second, we inquired whether these \nchanges varied as a function of age and SES. \nMethods:  High and low SES families with  6-month-old and 9 -month-old infants from in and around Shivgarh, \nrural Uttar Pradesh, India  took part in the study  (N=223 infants) . Data were collected from these families  at two \ntime-points. At the first time -point during infancy , children were 6 or 9 months of age, and at the second time -\npoint during toddlerhood , they were 18 or 21 months of age, respectively. Visual cognition  was assessed at both \ntime-points using a preferential looking task. In this task, two side -by-side blinking displays of colored squares \nwere presented, with one side showing a change in colors, while the colors on the other side stayed constant. Load \nwas varied between 1 and 3 items during infancy  and between 2 and 6 items during toddlerhood . Portable eye -\ntracking and video rec ordings were used to extract looking behaviour , and functional near -infrared spectroscopy \nwas used to collect brain function while children engaged with the task.  Two key measures of visual cognition \nwere extracted – total looking time (TLT) was calculated by summing the total time spent looking at both sides \nand, a change preference (CP) score was calculated by dividing the total time spent looking at the changing side \ndivided by TLT. Image reconstruction techniques were used to transform channel -based neuroimaging data into \nvoxel space  using segmented head volumes obtained from MRI scans . Linear mixed effects modelling was used \nto examine developmental changes and associations with age and SES.  \nResults. Our behavioural results revealed two key interactions involving age and SES. First, there was a positive \nassociation between CP scores during infancy and CP  scores during toddlerhood; however, th is association was \nstronger for high SES children  compared to low SES children . Second, we found that the positive association \nbetween CP scores in infancy and toddlerhood was generally stronger for the 9-month-old cohort compared to 6 -\nmonth-old cohort, except for the low SES 9 -month-old cohort with longer TLT. Our brain results revealed \nengagement across canonical regions of the frontoparietal visual cognition network.  There were developmental \nand SES-related effects in  left-lateralized anterior intraparietal sulcus  (laIPS), a region in the dorsal attention \nnetwork associated with maintaining working memory representations  and impacted by stunting status as \ndemonstrated by our previous work . Specifically, the 9 -month-old cohort showed greater laIPS activation from \ninfancy to toddlerhood, compared to the 6 -month-old cohort. Activation in this region was also associated with \nbehavioural measures : children with better CP scores showed an increase in laIPS activation from infancy to \ntoddlerhood compared to children with lower CP scores.  \nConclusions.  Our findings show that developmental changes in neurocognitive function in the first 1000 days of \nlife are affected by SES and cohort effects, thus, uniquely  contributing to the growing literature on neurocognition \nin children from LMIC countries.  4 of 398"
